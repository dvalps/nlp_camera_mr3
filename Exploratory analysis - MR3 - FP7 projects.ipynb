In the clean sky partnership program fuel saving and thus weight savings are a central issue towards achieving these ACARE goals. One accepted approach to achieving these goals is widespread use of composite materials in aircraft. Another approach is the use of uncontained engines mounted close to the fuselage, as suggested in the Clean Sky Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) initiative. Failure of rotating aircraft engine components may result in fragments thrown outwards at high velocity and may easily damage the fuselage or other primary structure. To prevent this damage occurring, impact shielding has to be integrated with the fuselage and other structures at risk. The main objective of this project was to design and manufacture three innovative shielding design concepts to protect critical components of an aircraft against high velocity shrapnel from an engine burst. In order to meet the requirement for low weight in aircraft applications, making the shielding from high performance fibres was an obvious solution. The concepts proposed therefore used well established high performance fibres and manufacturing methods to fit the requirements of medium to high maturity level and low manufacturing costs stated in the call. From the negotiations in 2012, the decision was made to divide the IMPSHIELD project into three projects (A, B and C). Then, since SICOMP coordinated the three projects and as the approach and structure were the same for the three projects, the consortium and project partners agreed to handle IMPSHIELD A, B and C as a single project from a management and reporting point of view. From a financial point of view, the summarized time spent on each project over the three reporting periods reflects the work done respectively in the projects. The kick-off meeting was held together with the IMPTEST project in April 2013 since the IMPSHIELD project was so closely connected to the IMPTEST project. It was agreed about having the project meetings together in the future. A lot of valuable time was spent on getting access to the projects as a coordinator for the three projects; it was finally solved in December 2014 one and a half year after the project started. Most of the design work for the three shields was performed by subcontractor ICON (Imperial College Consultants) in WP2 of each project. The differences in size and weight between the three projectiles led to changes in the design along the way for the three shields. The corrugated design for shield A was abandoned since the impact simulations showed that the waves should be too small for the smallest and lightest projectile, i.e. almost flat. The shields were built up from a number of flat 2mm S2-glass laminates depending of projectile, all in all 155 2mm laminates were manufactured for the phase one delivery of 15 A-shields. For the B shield the idea with folded loops was abandoned when the simulations showed that the folded loops will not unfold as wanted for these projectiles as they do for example on bird impact. A UHMWPE prepreg was used for the B-shields. The design calculations for shield C showed that an air gap (foam core) between the laminates in the shield did not improve the performance of the shields for these projectiles. The consortium decided to go for a pure aramid laminate solution built up from several 5mm laminates without an air gap, for phase one delivery 50 5mm laminates were manufactured. After initial compaction-, bleed- and process tests for the A- and C shields, the manufacturing (WP3) of the panels for phase one started at SICOMP according to the design agreed. Both shields were hot-pressed, but the application of the resin differed. For shield A the resin was applied using a spray-gun since the resin was a thermoset powder and for the C-shield the resin was an epoxy film. Shield B was manufactured according to the design specification with chosen high performance fibre, (UHMWPE) according to the prepreg solution, and hot-pressed, by Honeywell since they would not let the project buy just the material. The panels were delivered to SICOMP for control and making mounting holes to fit the test rig. Honeywell could not share all of the data with the project due to a mixture of the data being ITAR controlled or Honeywell proprietary. Analysis was performed at SICOMP to get at least some of the data needed for the evaluation of the B-panels. Problems getting the material needed and the IMPTEST-project not being able to fire their gas-gun as scheduled, due to safety regulations, to test the phase one panels led in November to an amendment for the project to be extended to July 2015. At the delayed “mid-term” review in January 2015 it was decided, from the phase one testing results in IMPTEST, that the project were to continue with the B- and C-panels for phase two and ageing. Most of the manufactured panels were delivered to Imperial College in London for phase two testing in IMPTEST, but five of each was kept for ageing at SICOMP. A literature review on the effects of environment of the materials was done (WP4) and led to the ageing conditions. The panels were aged in an environmental chamber for almost two month, monitoring the weight gain approximately ever 100th hour. After the ageing process, the panels were delivered to London for testing in IMPTEST. Some of the work and lessons learned in the IMPSHIELD projects will be included in the dissemination of the IMPTEST project Project Context and Objectives: Failure of rotating aircraft engine components may result in fragments thrown outwards at high velocity. Fragments from such components may easily damage the fuselage or other primary structure, and the risk is particularly serious from these uncontained engines. To prevent this damage occurring, impact shielding has to be integrated with the fuselage and other structures at risk. The main objective of this project was to design and manufacture three innovative shielding design concepts to protect critical components of an aircraft against high velocity shrapnel from an engine burst. In order to meet the requirement for low weight in aircraft applications, making the shielding from high performance fibres was an obvious solution. The concepts proposed therefore used well established high performance fibres and manufacturing methods to fit the requirements of medium to high maturity level and low manufacturing costs stated in the call. It is also expected that IMPSHIELD projects will provide test panels for the IMPTEST project and the following contributions to the Clean Sky programme: -Improved understanding of the efficiency of various impact shielding concepts -Improved understanding of manufacturing of ballistic shields for different environmental conditions -Provide a prototype structure using high performance fibres for use in ballistic shielding on aircraft Project Results: 1. Introduction The main S &amp;amp; T results/foregrounds of the three concepts within the IMPSHIELD projects regarding design and manufacturing of the composite laminates are described in the following text. The laminates, Impact Shields, from these projects are used in the IMPTEST (278368) project where the ballistic performance for the different designs and materials is tested and evaluated. The design of the shields was made from three different projectiles and performed by the subcontractor ICON (Imperial College Consultants). The fibre and resin for each concept is also presented with shield thicknesses and areal weights. The manufacturing, which according to the DoW is a bigger part of the project, was performed by the coordinating research institute Swerea SICOMP AB. 2. IMPSHIELD Design Concept A (Temperature range -55°C – 150°C) This concept requires a medium to high level of maturity of the technology. Also stipulated is the use of a low manufacturing cost of the shield which affects the design concept. 2.1. Initial Design Concept The first design for concept A (proposed in the application) was based on a single laminate with a corrugated dry backing layer. That design concept followed the so-called bi-stable [1] lamination technique in which material gradually activates during the impact event. The key aspects are the front face which slows the projectile. The concept could use novel 7 micron glass fibres, which have indicated an improvement over the mature 9 micron glass fibres. The composite has also been arranged in a novel geometrical configuration which has not been tested as a complete unit. 2.2. Final Design Calculations made by ICON showed that the corrugations will not work unless they are only few millimetres in length, which is not practical for draping the material unless it has a very low dtex and weight, which is assumed to be not possible. Also, the shear locking of the fabric is required to determine the wave length which requires physical tests. Hence the project should proceed with conventional laminate concept with the following properties: S2-glass dry summary Density 2.488g/cm3, E=90GPa, tensile strength= 2.34GPa Airbus projectile: tlam =30mm, Areal weight = 41 kg/m2 Dassault projectile: tlam =14mm, Areal weight = 19 kg/m2 Intermediate projectile: tlam =18mm, Areal weight = 24 kg/m2 2.3. Materials for Impshield A Woven S2 7μm was not possible to get delivered from Hexcel despite the fact that it was a “common style” material in their technical fabric handbook. Hexcel could only supply weaves in 9μm filament diameter. The 7 μm that Imperial College had at Sigmatex was not suitable for the shields since it was quite heavy and with a high dtex. So a 9 μm weave from Hexcel will be used. A PIMC (powder in mould coating) thermoset powder will be used as matrix material. The powder is tested to make a laminate “starved” in a controlled way by adding an amount of powder in between each layer. Application of powder repeatable for each layer will be important and will be made with electrostatic spray and a dispenser combined with thermal adhesion with scale. Curing of powder will probably occur in 150-200°C. Reinforcement: S2 Glass, HexForce® 06781 1270 Z6040 S-2 Glass Fabric (9μm) 8H Satin Weave from Hexcel.

Design Concept Impshield B (Temperature range -55°C – 85°C) The concept in this call requires a medium to high level of maturity of the technology without the necessity of aiming for a low cost manufacturing solution. 3.1. Initial Design Concept The NLR has developed previously developed the so-called ‘tensor skin concept’ [2] using Dyneema layers within an existing laminated composite. The concept was originally developed for a helicopter subfloor structure, and has been applied to meet birdstrike regulations within a composite leading edge. The leading edge skin structure contains a laminate (tensor) with folded loops which unfold on bird impact, effectively catching the bird. The composite skin laminate consists of multiple plies, of which the load-carrying plies transfer the normal operational aerodynamic load to the ribs. These plies therefore provide the usual leading edge skin stiffness. The second group of plies, the tensor plies, contain folded loops between the ribs, which are to unfold when a relatively high lateral load is applied to the skin. Under normal conditions these plies are additionally present without any function. In case of a relatively high lateral load, like a bird impact, all plies except the tensor plies fail. The unfolded plies are comparable to plastic hinges and are loaded in tension like a membrane. When completely unfolded, the vertical load compressively loads the ribs, which are then crushed in a controlled way in order to absorb sufficient bird kinetic energy. These designs were not optimised and do not use the most recent developments in material science, which could potentially produce a step change in the performance. Other concepts also use unfolding ideas, typically the so-called bi-stable [3] lamination technique could be used to activate material gradually during the impact event as an alternative to the corrugation concept. The basic concept consists of UHMWPE prepreg. The appropriate Dyneema for the concept could be HB50, contacts with DSM gave that the recently commercialised HB80 should be better, but unfortunately they were not willingly to supply the material to the project. Contact with Honeywell was taken and they provided materials similar to DSM:s Dyneema. 3.1.1. Shield thickness The thicknesses (mm) for the Airbus, Dassault and Intermediate (A, D and I) projectiles have been estimated based on three analytical methods. Jacobs and Van Dingenen [5] assumed the absorbed energy is proportional to mass below the strike face, while empirical scaling laws have been developed by Cunniff [4]. Dassault Method (11.8mm, 7.6mm and 10.0mm) [based on chart provided by Dassault] Jacobs et al Method (14.9mm, 6.8mm and 9.0mm) [based on HB2 only] Cunniffs Method (12.7mm, 6.2mm and 8.4mm) [for smaller HB26 plate geometry only, but relative velocities similar] 3.2. Final Design The thicknesses calculated by the design team at Honeywell according to the energy absorption and the provided projectile and the composite laminate data are: Airbus projectile: tlam =18.8mm, Areal weight = 18.6 kg/m2 Dassault projectile: tlam =9.5mm, Areal weight = 9.3 kg/m2 Intermediate projectile: tlam =12.8mm, Areal weight = 12.7 kg/m2 The shields are manufactured using a hot-press process at Honeywell in USA and delivered to SICOMP for inspection and analysis before shipping to London. 3.3.

Design Concept Impshield C (Temperature range -55°C – 150°C) This call is for a new concept with a low level of maturity of the technology without the necessity of aiming for a low cost manufacturing solution. 4.1. Initial Design Concept Most fibres can be combined with a resin, either thermoplastic or thermoset, and made into a UD, 2D woven or 3D woven layer or lamina layer. For the 2D and 3D woven architecture potentially different fibre types could be combined within a single layer. A series of layers could be graded in the through thickness direction of the armour, thus using each fibre type to its ‘best’ advantage. During a high-velocity impact event on a composite laminate, the reactions within each layer in the laminate and the response from the layers can vary significantly depending on the location within the laminate. The performance of each layer could therefore be designed and engineered specifically for the observed stress, strain, strain-rate and temperature distributions that occur at these different locations. The possibility of developing new novel high performance hybrid composite systems, which are not unusual in nature for improving performance under various dynamic load conditions; the spider’s web is probably one of the best examples where up to seven different silks with varying properties are used to optimize the performance of the web. Hybridising layers to produce structural armour has been investigated in an ad-hoc fashion in the open literature [6, 7]; however, no modelling was used to understand the behaviour. In the present proposal for the first concept it is proposed to use UD high performance fibre graded in the thickness direction as a cross-ply, typically in thicknesses of ~1-2mm. Between the high performance sub-laminates a foam layer would be used. The distance between the sub-laminates of high performances fibres allow the layers to act in a membrane action more readily. A high temperature thermoset or thermoplastic resin system could be used, however, it should be resin starved. The design calculations shows that it is better to make a base laminate of 5mm and a base core “air” of 10mm (based on the impact pulse duration), rather than changing the laminate and core for each design. Airbus projectile: tlam=25mm (5mm-10mm-5mm-10mm-5mm-10mm-5mm-10mm-5mm) Dassault projectile: tlam=10mm (5mm-10mm-5mm) Intermediate projectile: tlam=15mm (5mm-10mm-5mm-10mm-5mm) 4.2. Final Design The final design is changed at the project meeting in London at Imperial College 3rd of July and the core giving the “air gap” between the laminates is excluded. The laminates will be resin starved in the shooting window and more or less homogenous in the clamping frame area and manufactured at SICOMP using hot-press process. Airbus projectile: tlam=25mm (5mm-5mm-5mm-5mm-5mm), Areal weight = 41 kg/m2 Dassault projectile: tlam=10mm (5mm-5mm), Areal weight = 19 kg/m2 Intermediate projectile: tlam=15mm (5mm-5mm-5mm), Areal weight = 24 kg/m2 4.3.

Reference plates 5.1. Aluminium plates Dassault will supply 15 300x300x12mm Aluminium plates (AA2024). 5.2. Titanium plates SICOMP will supply five 300x300x12mm reference plates in Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V). Due to safety reasons at the laboratory at Imperial College limiting the gas gun pressure, thinner Titanium plates are supplied, i.e. five 300x300x6mm Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V). Holes will be cut in the titanium plates before delivery according to the mounting holes at the test rig. 6. Manufacturing of the shields 6.1. Manufacturing criteria’s for IMPSHIELD A and C The manufacturing processes for A- and C-panels are decided according to the following: a) The reinforcements will not be saturated with matrix No wetting process such as RTM or vacuum infusion is suitable The laminate will contain 3 fundamentals, resin / fibre / air b) Boundary conditions for manufacturing Fixed surface weight at reinforcements Fixed surface weight at adhesive film Designated thickness for the laminates for three different projectiles c) Evenly spread resin through the laminate stacking Minimised saturated areas d) Realistic number of manufacturing steps e) Highest nominal common thickness for the three designs 2 mm for IMPSHIELD A 5 mm for IMPSHIELD C f) Compaction force at reinforcements, “performance” of weaved geometry Geometry of reinforcement will give fibre fraction in Volume vs. compaction pressure Indicates the process window for selected reinforcements Reasonable fibre volume fraction Reasonable compaction forces The compaction tests and the fibre fraction from the shield design gives together with the laminate thicknesses a number of layers for each stack. This is shown in the manufacturing chapters for IMPSHIELD A and C. 7. Manufacturing of IMPSHIELD Panel A The panels for IMPSHIELD A are built up by stacking two millimetre laminates to get the three different shield thicknesses. This is a big advantage for the manufacturing process. 7.1. Process window and number of layers A big help to set up the manufacturing process is the use of a process window (PW). It illustrates a pressure interval, for the specific hot press used, where the manufacturing is most effective. The mould will not be filled to the left of the PW (lower pressure) and it is inefficient to go further to the right of the PW (higher pressure) since the fibre fraction will just be marginally higher. The aim to build two millimetre laminates gives a number of S2 glass weave layers to be inside the process window. Choosing eight layers will put the process in the middle of the process window. The laminates are built up, two side by side, by S2 Glass weave and a resin powder, with more resin in the frame area and less in the “shooting window”. 7.2. Building the stack of reinforcement and matrix a) The S2 glass weave is cut in the cutting machine to the size of two parallel laminates, to make the preform and stacking process more effective. b) The ply stack is built on a warm plate on top on a scale, and the powder matrix is applied to the right weight is reached for each layer. The shooting area is masked for two layers to get the right fibre fraction. c) When the stack has been built it is consolidated with a roll. d) The 700x350mm laminate stack is cut in two halves, 350x350mm before pressing 7.3. Hot pressing the stacks e) The press tool is heated to 150°C and the press force is set to 30 tons f) One Teflon sheet is put on the bottom tool surface g) The two 350x350mm stacks are put into the press tool with 2mm distances around the stacks h) One Teflon sheet is put on top of the laminate stacks and the press is closed i) After 15 minutes the press is opened and the laminates are removed 7.4. Light inspection After the laminates are removed from the press they are weighted and inspected by light to see if there are any major errors and for post testing comparison with pictures in IMPTEST. 7.5. Water jet cutting of outer dimensions and holes The laminates are cut to the right dimension using water jet. The holes to fit into the mounting frame are also cut. 7.6. Stacking the laminates to the three different shield thicknesses When the laminates have got the right dimensions they are stacked together to build the three different shield thicknesses. 7.7. Production rate and cost at SICOMP manufacturing facility In the manufacturing facility at SICOMP 12 mm laminate (350x350mm) per hour is produced and the cost for material (resin and reinforcement) and man time is €20.5 per millimetre laminate. 8. Manufacturing of IMPSHIELD Panel B The B-panels are manufactured by Honeywell due to the fact that some of the data for the materials and the process are under ITAR control or Honeywell proprietary. The manufacturing process is described by Honeywell in the steps below. 8.1. Processing Guidelines for Honeywell Ballistic Materials, Hard Armour Products Honeywell Spectra Shield Hard Armour Products, Compression Moulding Process a) Insert material stack and preheat centreline to 275°F using a panel/part contact pressure less than 200 psi and a platen temperature of 285°F. b) Hold centreline at 275°F for 15 min. (preheat time) under panel/part contact pressure of less than 200 psi. c) Apply 3500 psi as standard pressure on panel/part and hold at 275°F for 15 min (dwell time). d) Initiate cool cycle. e) Cool centreline of material stack to 125°F. f) Release applied tonnage. g) Remove from press. The total Areal density for SR-3136 is given by Honeywell, 257 ± 8g /m2. 8.2. Water jet cutting holes and light inspection The panels delivered to SICOMP are then cut for mounting in the test rig according to the drawing provided by Imperial College Consultants (ICON). The panels are also inspected with light before delivery to ICON and for post testing comparison with pictures in IMPTEST. 8.3. Optical fibre fraction control Since fibre fraction data is unavailable from Honeywell, due to ITAR control and Honeywell proprietary, optical inspections at SICOMP give the volume fibre fraction, Vf, for the panels to 69.5%. 8.4. Production cost for Honeywell panels The cost for the laminates from Honeywell is approximately €23 per millimetre laminate (300x300mm) from what is ordered for phase one testing, i.e. five laminates of each concept. The order for phase two (and three), ten respectively fifteen panels of the two remaining concepts gives a cost of €11 per millimetre. 9. Manufacturing of IMPSHIELD Panel C The panels for shield C are built up by stacking five millimetre laminates to the three different shield thicknesses. This is a big advantage for the manufacturing process. The laminates are built up by aramid weave and epoxy resin film with more resin in the frame area and less in the “shooting window”. 9.1. Process window and number of layers A big help to set up the manufacturing process is the use of a process window (PW). It illustrates a pressure interval, for the specific hot press used, where the manufacturing is most effective. The mould will not be filled to the left of the PW (lower pressure) and it is inefficient to go further to the right of the PW (higher pressure) since the fibre fraction will just be marginally higher. The aim to build five millimetre laminates gives a number of aramid weave layers to be inside the process window. Choosing ten layers will put the process in the middle of the process window. 9.2. Building the stack of reinforcement and matrix a) The aramid weave and resin film are cut and put into separate piles aa) Ten weaves are put in each pile and weighted bb The resin film stripes and sheets are just put in two separate piles b) Five layers with complete resin film coverage are made; plastic protective film is first removed c) Four layers with stripes of resin film on both sides of the aramid weave in the frame area are made; plastic protective film is first removed d) One layer with stripes of resin film on one side of the aramid weave in the frame area is made, plastic protective film is first removed e) The ten plys are placed on a 50°C warm plate and individually rolled to get the resin film into the weave, consolidation. f) The pile of ten plys is the put into the freezer, to ease the removal of the protective paper g) Ply by ply is then taken out from the freezer and put together in the right order after removing the protective paper from the resin film h) The finished stack of ten plys is weighted 9.3. Hot pressing the stacks a) The press tool is heated to 150°C and the press force is set to 30 tons b) One Teflon sheet is put on the bottom tool surface c) Two stacks are put onto the bottom tool d) Five millimetre distance plates are put onto the bottom tool around the stacks e) One Teflon sheet is put on top of the stacks f) The tool is closed and the press holds the force for 15minutes g) The tool is opened and the laminates are removed and put onto a 50°C plate for cooling h) The laminates are weighted after cooling 9.4. Light inspection After the laminates are weighted they are inspected by light to see if there are any major errors and for post testing comparison with pictures in IMPTEST. 9.5. Water jet cutting holes and outer dimensions The laminates are cut to the right dimension using water jet. The holes to fit into the mounting frame are also cut. 9.6. Stacking the laminates to the three different shield thicknesses After the water jet the laminates are dried in an oven at 70°C to remove any extra humidity in the laminates from the cutting and then stacked together for the three different configurations. 9.7. Production rate and cost at SICOMP manufacturing facility In the manufacturing facility at SICOMP 15 mm laminate (350x350mm) per hour is produced and the cost for material (resin and reinforcement) and man time is €25 per millimetre laminate. Potential Impact: Since the aim of the Clean Sky initiative is to provide radically greener air transport based on novel concepts for engines and aircraft design. In this way Clean Sky is expected to provide major steps towards the environmental goals for aviation in 2020 set out by ACARE. Within Clean Sky the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) ITD will specifically consider the use of these novel concepts for a new aircraft configuration. The impact shields designed within the IMPSHIELD projects will provide the basis for the shielding structures that will be incorporated in aircraft structures. The development of manufacturing methods for the concepts means a methodology of producing the shields has been tested allowing high technology readiness levels of the shields for industrial implementation. During the design phase it has been learned that design concepts working for larger impact specimens with other weights and velocities did not work for the projectiles in these projects From the manufacturing work in the project it was learned how to manufacture panels with resin starved areas using an electrostatic spray-gun in the process. And lessons have also been learned on how to produce a lot of laminates by hand in an ergonomic and effective way. The focus in the project has been to design and manufacture the shields for the IMPTEST project. All the dissemination effort was planned to come from the IMPTEST project with some input from the IMPSHIELD project.

The Marie Curie Fellow (MCF) activity focused on the implementation of quantum optics experiments using integrated optical devices in lithium niobate and lithium tantalate. It took place between the Nanoscience and Quantum Information Centre and the Engineering Department at the University of Bristol, in the United Kingdom. Project objectives The main objective of this project is the development of a platform for the implementation of quantum optical experiments with waveguides. A range of new devices, including photon pair sources and fast reconfigurable circuits have been developed on lithium niobate and lithium tantalate substrate. These two crystals are compatible with the proton-exchange technique for the fabrication of high-quality optical waveguides and with periodic poling for the generation of photon pairs via parametric down conversion. The technology developed in this project paves the way towards a common platform for the integration of all the basic components required for the development of new quantum information technologies. Project work A new fabrication facility for the realisation of proton-exchanged waveguides in lithium niobate and lithium tantalate was established in the first year of the project. An extensive investigation was carried out in order to optimise the coupling efficiency of the fabricated devices with optical fibres and minimise their propagation losses. In order to fabricate electro-optical reconfigurable devices, metal electrodes were deposited on top of the waveguide, and phase modulation at a rate of 1MHz was accomplished. New electrode designs are currently under investigation in order to improve the speed of the devices. In this preliminary phase, the fabrication process was optimised for devices operating at 800 nm and 1550 nm wavelength. After the characterisation of several waveguides we decided to focus on 1550 nm as the working wavelength since the fabrication tolerances are more stable and because this regime offers the direct integration with standard optical components currently used in telecommunications. Furthermore, this decision was supported by the availability of high-efficiency superconducting single photon detectors for 1550 nm photons through collaboration with Heriot-Watt University (Scotland). The generation of non-classical states of light in waveguides has been achieved on two different platforms. Single photon generation in periodically poled lithium tantalate waveguide has been demonstrated in an experiment that was part of a collaboration with the University of Sydney and MacQuaire University in Sydney, Australia (App. Phys. Lett. 99, 081110(2011)). Within this partnership, infra-red single photon generation in chalcogenide waveguide was also demonstrated (App. Phys. Lett. 98, 051101(2011)). Project results A major accomplishment achieved during this project was the first experimental demonstration of a lithium niobate integrated device operating in the quantum regime (Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 053601(2012)). In this experiment, single photons at telecom wavelength have been manipulated in path and polarisation in fast electro-optical lithium niobate devices showing that the same technological platform can be used to manipulate both path and polarisation at high speed. This work received great attention from the scientific community and was featured on the physics website Physorg.com. The MCF played a leading role in the collaboration that implemented the most complex reconfigurable quantum device reported to date (Nat. Photon. 6, 45(2012)), featured in the major Italian newspaper La Repubblica including an interview of the candidate and his collaborators. The work developed in this project attracted the interest of the telecommunication giant Nokia which collaborated with the MCF for the implementation of new reconfigurable circuits (New J. Phys. 13, 115009 (2011)). During this project a new fabrication facility for integrated electro-optical devices was established at the University of Bristol together with the development of a reliable fabrication process for integrated optical devices operating at telecom wavelength. Major results have been in the implementation of photon pair sources in waveguide and the demonstration of reconfigurable integrated optical circuits. The main results in the generation of photon pairs in waveguide are:- demonstration of photon pair generation in lithium tantalate periodically poled waveguide using an innovative cascaded nonlinear process (App. Phys. Lett. 99, 081110(2011)); and - demonstration of photon pair generation in chalcogenide waveguide (App. Phys. Lett. 98, 051101(2011)). The results obtained in the implementation of reconfigurable quantum circuits with waveguide are: - first experimental demonstration of a fast, reconfigurable lithium niobate circuit operating in the quantum regime (Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 053601(2012)); - implementation of the most complex reconfigurable optical circuits to date (Nat. Photon. 6, 45(2012)); and - implementation of a new reconfigurable circuits [New J. Phys. 13, 115009 (2011)]. In addition, an invited news and views written by the fellow on integrated quantum devices has been published on Nature (M. Lobino and J. L. O&amp;#39;Brien, Entangled Photons on a chip, Nature 469, 43 (2011)) These overall results obtained in this project represent the foundation for the development of a new platform that will incorporate all the main elements required for quantum photonics applications on a single chip. Expected results and potential impact The present project developed the foundation of new technological platform for the integration of optical quantum devices on a single platform. The scientific results obtained pave the way towards the realisation of real-world devices that exploit the potential of quantum mechanics for several applications, including computation, communication and simulation of quantum systems. While it is currently not known exactly what form future quantum technologies will take, it is clear that quantum information will be transmitted in quantum states of photons and therefore that optical quantum information processing will take place. It also seems clear that if quantum photonic technologies are to be realised, we will need to harness and ultimately drive the latest developments in the field of photonics, ranging from classical telecommunications to bio-photonics. In the longer term, quantum technology has the potential for a great impact on society: the best-known method for securing information transmission is to encode secure cryptographic keys with quantum states of light. The heavy reliance on transmitting sensitive information by individuals, governments and industry places a high priority on improving secure data transmission. A large proportion of society therefore stands to benefit from the security offered by quantum communication. A full-scale universal quantum computer using any physical system is still a long way from realisation. Meanwhile, there is growing industrial interest in such technology for small-scale quantum simulators, which are a near-term prospect. This project is complementary to mainstream R&amp;amp;D directions, developing the necessary tools, technologies and concepts that will be required to move QIST to the next level of complexity.&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td width=50%&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:0.0% data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right data-html=true data-delay=500&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 2 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;th width=50%&gt;Project Context and Objectives: The LEAPFROG HCI-DI project goal is to expand the research and innovation potential of the Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute (M-ITI) of the University of Madeira through the hiring of an ERA Chair in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Design Innovation (DI). The project aims at unlocking the full potential of interdisciplinary research in interactive technologies, while strengthening innovation and knowledge transfer activities in close collaboration with local and global industrial partners and contributing to the smart specialization strategy of Madeira. To this end, funding this project proposal will support the following main activities: 1. Upgrade the RDT capacity and capability by expanding the human potential and fostering a critical mass of researchers with inter-disciplinary expertise in human-computer interaction (HCI) looking at new ways to examine and communicate the potential of emerging technologies in areas such as robotics, biotechnology, nanotechnology and informatics, as well as their impacts in key areas of contemporary life, in particular aging populations, sustainability and digital culture. The hiring of an ERA Chair in HCI-DI will be instrumental in order to raise the profile of M-ITI in and build a critical mass of researchers in the above-mentioned key emerging areas. 2. Improve M-ITI’s innovation potential and impact at the regional, national and European levels, through design-driven innovation. Such approach will unravel the impact of open innovation and crowdsourcing on education, training and knowledge transfer, and extend the creative research capabilities of individuals and organizations in the region. For such an impact to be effective we need to acquire and install critical equipment for test beds and prototypes in the regional strategic application areas of tourism, aging populations and sustainability, which leverage the outermost region of Madeira as a natural living lab for interactive technologies. 3. Raise international awareness about the institute and connect M-ITI and its industry affiliates to the global knowledge networks: work with mentoring institutes based at prestigious universities in Europe, which have agreed to serve as mentors by sharing their knowledge and promoting the exchange of key personnel; and continue to deepen the strong partnerships established with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), which include joint research and advanced training programs. As a consequence of these activities we aim to better integrate M-ITI with the European Research Area (ERA) and, in particular, improve the participation of M-ITI and associated entities of the recently created regional system for R&amp;amp;D+I, thereby increasing the level of participation of the institute in the Horizon 2020 programs. Project Results: The work in this reporting period was mainly related to successfully hiring the ERA Chair holder, establishing the quality procedures of the project, secondments and networking with institutions and finally the development of research capacities and communication and dissemination activities. Specifically we managed to successfully kick-off the project and establish the management and structure (including the management unit and steering committee). We also defined the detailed strategic plan for the project through a participatory workshop facilitated by external consultants which helped define the strategic vision for M-ITI under the ERAChair project and also define a generic profile for the ERA Chair to be recruited and passed on to the search committee. Other management issues involved provisioning of resources, definition of the communication and dissemination plan, including the recruitment and training of staff for some key activities as described in the respective work packages. These management activities together with the establishment and advice of the search committee lead to an active recruitment plan in which we privileged sending M-ITI faculty to different international conferences and workshop in order to reach out key people that could potentially apply to the public announcement. In addition we designed a communication strategy for the widely publicized ads which were published in selected magazines and websites targeting the HCI and design research communities. In parallel with the recruitment efforts we successfully started several activities related to the development and sustainability of research capacities. We organized several training activities for faculty and staff and sent one staff member for a master in project management in Brussels. This staff member is currently the main administrative point of contact for the ERA Chair project. Several exchange and secondment activities started mainly with preparatory meetings with some key partner institutions which also coincided with some recruitment and dissemination activities. These are currently passed to the ERA Chair holder for consideration for future development. We also welcomed several researchers in exchange activities in M-ITI promoting a wider engagement of faculty, students and staff with the forthcoming activities. In terms of communication and dissemination, and according to the respective plan, we conducted a complete redesign of the corporate identity of M-ITI in light of the visioning workshop. These activities originated a totally redesigned image for the institute which includes all the stationary, physical logos and promotional material. These activities were also disseminated through the existing channels, including local authorities, companies and existing academic partners (LARSYS, UMa, Carnegie Mellon, etc.). A website for the project was also created and mainly used to promote the hiring of the ERA Chair. Several PR activities, including a wide dissemination of the successful hiring of the ERA Chair were conducted as part of the communication and dissemination plan. Potential Impact: Overall the activities of the project so far have lead to the successful hiring of the ERA Chair holder and a substantial increase of the visibility and networking capacities of M-ITI. In particular the reported project activities already enabled M-ITI to have a wider presence in the HCI and Design Innovation communities through the dissemination of the ERA Chair project and the announcement of the hiring of a world-class researcher with a strong background in technologies to rebalance globalism. The ERA Chair holder was also involved in a proposal for the Horizon 2020 Teaming call which already reflects the vision of M-ITI as a design center for global change. Therefore the ERA Chair holder was already capable of influencing the research direction of M-ITI aiming for a more competitive and distinguished profile in the European Research Area. At a different level the activities of the project so far already enabled some training of faculty and staff in preparation and management of Horizon 2020 projects, leading to several project submissions and the upgrading of project management at M-ITI.

To this end, we (1) characterize the sources of variability (on stochastic, regulatory and evolutionary scales), (2) reveal principles by which this variability is buffered to ensure robustness of biological functioning and (3) characterize biological mechanisms that incorporate variability to enable computation not possible by the deterministic dynamics. Our study revealed principles by which developmental robustness is maintained and in particular the means by which embryo pattern scales with embryo size. It further revealed the function of recurrent motif in nutrient homeostasis and defined a role of gene expression noise in this computation.&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td width=50%&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:0.0% data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right data-html=true data-delay=500&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 2 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;th width=50%&gt;The proteins that are the most difficult to evaluate structurally are those which have several large, well-structured units connected by flexible linking strands. You can think of them like a plate of spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs are big and obvious, but the spaghetti is so random and sprawling that the fine details of each strand go unnoticed. When it comes to protein structure elucidation, there is a gap in the market for anyone willing to do battle with these challenging opponents. Their enormous size coupled with the randomness of the linking strands mean there is no single technique which can provide information on the overall structure. Biologists are beginning to look at the working life of our cells – how molecules are moved around, metabolised and synthesised – with continually increasing resolution. But on the other hand, another breed of scientists, structural biologists, are looking at the structures of enormous protein architectures. Scientists are good at both things separately, but it is sometimes hard to relate the fine details to the bigger picture; the spaghetti to the meatballs. Did someone call for a physicist? Bartosz Rozycki, a Marie Curie fellow, currently based at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Germany, is trying to bridge that gap. Rozycki’s background is in theoretical physics, which he studied first in his native Poland, and then in Germany and at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA. As a student he got interested in biology, and he is now using his specialist knowledge to probe deeper than ever before into some of these most challenging of protein structures. Rozycki is particularly interested in the lengthily-named Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT for short), a protein complex of more than 2,000 amino acids, consisting of tightly-defined regions connected by stringy peptide loops. The ESCRT sorts proteins expressed on cells’ surfaces into particular vesicles, which Rozycki calls the “trash cans of the cell.” Periodically, these proteins get damaged or need to be swapped, so the ESCRT sorts out the chaff, packages it into vesicles and sends them off to be metabolised. That might sound like a pretty complex task for an inanimate protein to do – and it is. Scientists have been puzzling over how the packaging up process works for some time, but without knowing the structure of ESCRT they can only make guesses. What is more, ESCRT is a protein complex known to be hi-jacked by envelope viruses like HIV when, having done their dastardly work, they need to make an exit from a cell. They cannot escape from the cell without a disguise, and so they use ESCRT to package themselves into vesicles which can bud out from the cell membrane unnoticed. Again, if scientists could unravel the mechanisms, new insights into the disease pathways could be unveiled and new therapeutic strategies envisaged.&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td width=50%&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:0.0% data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right data-html=true data-delay=500&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 2 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=other&gt;&lt;th width=50%&gt;Other values (21865)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td width=50%&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:100.0% data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right data-html=true data-delay=500&gt; 21866 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12 text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-default btn-sm&quot; data-toggle=collapse data-target=&quot;#bottom-5532336694208989606, #minifreqtable5532336694208989606&quot; aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapseExample&gt;Toggle details&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=bottom-5532336694208989606 class=collapse&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;row spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;nav nav-tabs&quot; role=tablist&gt;&lt;li role=presentation class=active&gt;&lt;a href=#5532336694208989606bottom-5532336694208989606common_values aria-controls=5532336694208989606bottom-5532336694208989606common_values role=tab data-toggle=tab&gt;Common Values&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li role=presentation&gt;&lt;a href=#5532336694208989606bottom-5532336694208989606tbl aria-controls=5532336694208989606bottom-5532336694208989606tbl role=tab data-toggle=tab&gt;Length&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=tab-content&gt;&lt;div role=tabpanel class=&quot;tab-pane col-sm-12 active&quot; id=5532336694208989606bottom-5532336694208989606common_values&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;freq table table-hover table-striped&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Value&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Count&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Frequency (%)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=&quot;Executive Summary:\n",
       "Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE) have set out a goal of reducing fuel consumption per passenger by 50% from the levels in 2000 by 2020. In the clean sky partnership program fuel saving and thus weight savings are a central issue towards achieving these ACARE goals. One accepted approach to achieving these goals is widespread use of composite materials in aircraft. Another approach is the use of uncontained engines mounted close to the fuselage, as suggested in the Clean Sky Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) initiative. Failure of rotating aircraft engine components may result in fragments thrown outwards at high velocity and may easily damage the fuselage or other primary structure. To prevent this damage occurring, impact shielding has to be integrated with the fuselage and other structures at risk. The main objective of this project was to design and manufacture three innovative shielding design concepts to protect critical components of an aircraft against high velocity shrapnel from an engine burst. In order to meet the requirement for low weight in aircraft applications, making the shielding from high performance fibres was an obvious solution. The concepts proposed therefore used well established high performance fibres and manufacturing methods to fit the requirements of medium to high maturity level and low manufacturing costs stated in the call. \n",
       "From the negotiations in 2012, the decision was made to divide the IMPSHIELD project into three projects (A, B and C). Then, since SICOMP coordinated the three projects and as the approach and structure were the same for the three projects, the consortium and project partners agreed to handle IMPSHIELD A, B and C as a single project from a management and reporting point of view. From a financial point of view, the summarized time spent on each project over the three reporting periods reflects the work done respectively in the projects.\n",
       "The kick-off meeting was held together with the IMPTEST project in April 2013 since the IMPSHIELD project was so closely connected to the IMPTEST project. It was agreed about having the project meetings together in the future. A lot of valuable time was spent on getting access to the projects as a coordinator for the three projects; it was finally solved in December 2014 one and a half year after the project started.\n",
       "Most of the design work for the three shields was performed by subcontractor ICON (Imperial College Consultants) in WP2 of each project. The differences in size and weight between the three projectiles led to changes in the design along the way for the three shields. \n",
       "The corrugated design for shield A was abandoned since the impact simulations showed that the waves should be too small for the smallest and lightest projectile, i.e. almost flat. The shields were built up from a number of flat 2mm S2-glass laminates depending of projectile, all in all 155 2mm laminates were manufactured for the phase one delivery of 15 A-shields.\n",
       "For the B shield the idea with folded loops was abandoned when the simulations showed that the folded loops will not unfold as wanted for these projectiles as they do for example on bird impact. A UHMWPE prepreg was used for the B-shields.\n",
       "The design calculations for shield C showed that an air gap (foam core) between the laminates in the shield did not improve the performance of the shields for these projectiles. The consortium decided to go for a pure aramid laminate solution built up from several 5mm laminates without an air gap, for phase one delivery 50 5mm laminates were manufactured.\n",
       "After initial compaction-, bleed- and process tests for the A- and C shields, the manufacturing (WP3) of the panels for phase one started at SICOMP according to the design agreed. Both shields were hot-pressed, but the application of the resin differed. For shield A the resin was applied using a spray-gun since the resin was a thermoset powder and for the C-shield the resin was an epoxy film. Shield B was manufactured according to the design specification with chosen high performance fibre, (UHMWPE) according to the prepreg solution, and hot-pressed, by Honeywell since they would not let the project buy just the material. The panels were delivered to SICOMP for control and making mounting holes to fit the test rig. Honeywell could not share all of the data with the project due to a mixture of the data being ITAR controlled or Honeywell proprietary. Analysis was performed at SICOMP to get at least some of the data needed for the evaluation of the B-panels. \n",
       "Problems getting the material needed and the IMPTEST-project not being able to fire their gas-gun as scheduled, due to safety regulations, to test the phase one panels led in November to an amendment for the project to be extended to July 2015. At the delayed “mid-term” review in January 2015 it was decided, from the phase one testing results in IMPTEST, that the project were to continue with the B- and C-panels for phase two and ageing. Most of the manufactured panels were delivered to Imperial College in London for phase two testing in IMPTEST, but five of each was kept for ageing at SICOMP. A literature review on the effects of environment of the materials was done (WP4) and led to the ageing conditions. The panels were aged in an environmental chamber for almost two month, monitoring the weight gain approximately ever 100th hour. After the ageing process, the panels were delivered to London for testing in IMPTEST.\n",

       "1. Introduction\n",
       "The main S &amp; T results/foregrounds of the three concepts within the IMPSHIELD projects regarding design and manufacturing of the composite laminates are described in the following text. The laminates, Impact Shields, from these projects are used in the IMPTEST (278368) project where the ballistic performance for the different designs and materials is tested and evaluated. The design of the shields was made from three different projectiles and performed by the subcontractor ICON (Imperial College Consultants). The fibre and resin for each concept is also presented with shield thicknesses and areal weights. The manufacturing, which according to the DoW is a bigger part of the project, was performed by the coordinating research institute Swerea SICOMP AB. \n",

       "This concept requires a medium to high level of maturity of the technology. Also stipulated is the use of a low manufacturing cost of the shield which affects the design concept.\n",
       "2.1. Initial Design Concept\n",
       "The first design for concept A (proposed in the application) was based on a single laminate with a corrugated dry backing layer. That design concept followed the so-called bi-stable [1] lamination technique in which material gradually activates during the impact event.\n",
       "The key aspects are the front face which slows the projectile. The concept could use novel 7 micron glass fibres, which have indicated an improvement over the mature 9 micron glass fibres. The composite has also been arranged in a novel geometrical configuration which has not been tested as a complete unit.\n",
       "2.2. Final Design \n",
       "Calculations made by ICON showed that the corrugations will not work unless they are only few millimetres in length, which is not practical for draping the material unless it has a very low dtex and weight, which is assumed to be not possible. Also, the shear locking of the fabric is required to determine the wave length which requires physical tests. Hence the project should proceed with conventional laminate concept with the following properties:\n",

       "Woven S2 7μm was not possible to get delivered from Hexcel despite the fact that it was a “common style” material in their technical fabric handbook. Hexcel could only supply weaves in 9μm filament diameter. The 7 μm that Imperial College had at Sigmatex was not suitable for the shields since it was quite heavy and with a high dtex. So a 9 μm weave from Hexcel will be used. A PIMC (powder in mould coating) thermoset powder will be used as matrix material. The powder is tested to make a laminate “starved” in a controlled way by adding an amount of powder in between each layer. Application of powder repeatable for each layer will be important and will be made with electrostatic spray and a dispenser combined with thermal adhesion with scale. Curing of powder will probably occur in 150-200°C.\n",

       "The NLR has developed previously developed the so-called ‘tensor skin concept’ [2] using Dyneema layers within an existing laminated composite. The concept was originally developed for a helicopter subfloor structure, and has been applied to meet birdstrike regulations within a composite leading edge. The leading edge skin structure contains a laminate (tensor) with folded loops which unfold on bird impact, effectively catching the bird. The composite skin laminate consists of multiple plies, of which the load-carrying plies transfer the normal operational aerodynamic load to the ribs. These plies therefore provide the usual leading edge skin stiffness. The second group of plies, the tensor plies, contain folded loops between the ribs, which are to unfold when a relatively high lateral load is applied to the skin. Under normal conditions these plies are additionally present without any function. In case of a relatively high lateral load, like a bird impact, all plies except the tensor plies fail. The unfolded plies are comparable to plastic hinges and are loaded in tension like a membrane. When completely unfolded, the vertical load compressively loads the ribs, which are then crushed in a controlled way in order to absorb sufficient bird kinetic energy. These designs were not optimised and do not use the most recent developments in material science, which could potentially produce a step change in the performance. Other concepts also use unfolding ideas, typically the so-called bi-stable [3] lamination technique could be used to activate material gradually during the impact event as an alternative to the corrugation concept. The basic concept consists of UHMWPE prepreg.\n",
       "The appropriate Dyneema for the concept could be HB50, contacts with DSM gave that the recently commercialised HB80 should be better, but unfortunately they were not willingly to supply the material to the project. Contact with Honeywell was taken and they provided materials similar to DSM:s Dyneema.\n",

       "4.1. Initial Design Concept\n",
       "Most fibres can be combined with a resin, either thermoplastic or thermoset, and made into a UD, 2D woven or 3D woven layer or lamina layer. For the 2D and 3D woven architecture potentially different fibre types could be combined within a single layer. A series of layers could be graded in the through thickness direction of the armour, thus using each fibre type to its ‘best’ advantage. During a high-velocity impact event on a composite laminate, the reactions within each layer in the laminate and the response from the layers can vary significantly depending on the location within the laminate. The performance of each layer could therefore be designed and engineered specifically for the observed stress, strain, strain-rate and temperature distributions that occur at these different locations. \n",
       "The possibility of developing new novel high performance hybrid composite systems, which are not unusual in nature for improving performance under various dynamic load conditions; the spider’s web is probably one of the best examples where up to seven different silks with varying properties are used to optimize the performance of the web. Hybridising layers to produce structural armour has been investigated in an ad-hoc fashion in the open literature [6, 7]; however, no modelling was used to understand the behaviour.\n",
       "In the present proposal for the first concept it is proposed to use UD high performance fibre graded in the thickness direction as a cross-ply, typically in thicknesses of ~1-2mm. Between the high performance sub-laminates a foam layer would be used. The distance between the sub-laminates of high performances fibres allow the layers to act in a membrane action more readily. A high temperature thermoset or thermoplastic resin system could be used, however, it should be resin starved. \n",
       "The design calculations shows that it is better to make a base laminate of 5mm and a base core “air” of 10mm (based on the impact pulse duration), rather than changing the laminate and core for each design.\n",

       "N/A&quot;&gt;Executive Summary: Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE) have set out a goal of reducing fuel consumption per passenger by 50% from the levels in 2000 by 2020. In the clean sky partnership program fuel saving and thus weight savings are a central issue towards achieving these ACARE goals. One accepted approach to achieving these goals is widespread use of composite materials in aircraft. Another approach is the use of uncontained engines mounted close to the fuselage, as suggested in the Clean Sky Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) initiative. Failure of rotating aircraft engine components may result in fragments thrown outwards at high velocity and may easily damage the fuselage or other primary structure. To prevent this damage occurring, impact shielding has to be integrated with the fuselage and other structures at risk. The main objective of this project was to design and manufacture three innovative shielding design concepts to protect critical components of an aircraft against high velocity shrapnel from an engine burst. In order to meet the requirement for low weight in aircraft applications, making the shielding from high performance fibres was an obvious solution. The concepts proposed therefore used well established high performance fibres and manufacturing methods to fit the requirements of medium to high maturity level and low manufacturing costs stated in the call. From the negotiations in 2012, the decision was made to divide the IMPSHIELD project into three projects (A, B and C). Then, since SICOMP coordinated the three projects and as the approach and structure were the same for the three projects, the consortium and project partners agreed to handle IMPSHIELD A, B and C as a single project from a management and reporting point of view. From a financial point of view, the summarized time spent on each project over the three reporting periods reflects the work done respectively in the projects. The kick-off meeting was held together with the IMPTEST project in April 2013 since the IMPSHIELD project was so closely connected to the IMPTEST project. It was agreed about having the project meetings together in the future. A lot of valuable time was spent on getting access to the projects as a coordinator for the three projects; it was finally solved in December 2014 one and a half year after the project started. Most of the design work for the three shields was performed by subcontractor ICON (Imperial College Consultants) in WP2 of each project. The differences in size and weight between the three projectiles led to changes in the design along the way for the three shields. The corrugated design for shield A was abandoned since the impact simulations showed that the waves should be too small for the smallest and lightest projectile, i.e. almost flat. The shields were built up from a number of flat 2mm S2-glass laminates depending of projectile, all in all 155 2mm laminates were manufactured for the phase one delivery of 15 A-shields. For the B shield the idea with folded loops was abandoned when the simulations showed that the folded loops will not unfold as wanted for these projectiles as they do for example on bird impact. A UHMWPE prepreg was used for the B-shields. The design calculations for shield C showed that an air gap (foam core) between the laminates in the shield did not improve the performance of the shields for these projectiles. The consortium decided to go for a pure aramid laminate solution built up from several 5mm laminates without an air gap, for phase one delivery 50 5mm laminates were manufactured. After initial compaction-, bleed- and process tests for the A- and C shields, the manufacturing (WP3) of the panels for phase one started at SICOMP according to the design agreed. Both shields were hot-pressed, but the application of the resin differed. For shield A the resin was applied using a spray-gun since the resin was a thermoset powder and for the C-shield the resin was an epoxy film. Shield B was manufactured according to the design specification with chosen high performance fibre, (UHMWPE) according to the prepreg solution, and hot-pressed, by Honeywell since they would not let the project buy just the material. The panels were delivered to SICOMP for control and making mounting holes to fit the test rig. Honeywell could not share all of the data with the project due to a mixture of the data being ITAR controlled or Honeywell proprietary. Analysis was performed at SICOMP to get at least some of the data needed for the evaluation of the B-panels. Problems getting the material needed and the IMPTEST-project not being able to fire their gas-gun as scheduled, due to safety regulations, to test the phase one panels led in November to an amendment for the project to be extended to July 2015. At the delayed “mid-term” review in January 2015 it was decided, from the phase one testing results in IMPTEST, that the project were to continue with the B- and C-panels for phase two and ageing. Most of the manufactured panels were delivered to Imperial College in London for phase two testing in IMPTEST, but five of each was kept for ageing at SICOMP. A literature review on the effects of environment of the materials was done (WP4) and led to the ageing conditions. The panels were aged in an environmental chamber for almost two month, monitoring the weight gain approximately ever 100th hour. After the ageing process, the panels were delivered to London for testing in IMPTEST. Some of the work and lessons learned in the IMPSHIELD projects will be included in the dissemination of the IMPTEST project Project Context and Objectives: Failure of rotating aircraft engine components may result in fragments thrown outwards at high velocity. Fragments from such components may easily damage the fuselage or other primary structure, and the risk is particularly serious from these uncontained engines. To prevent this damage occurring, impact shielding has to be integrated with the fuselage and other structures at risk. The main objective of this project was to design and manufacture three innovative shielding design concepts to protect critical components of an aircraft against high velocity shrapnel from an engine burst. In order to meet the requirement for low weight in aircraft applications, making the shielding from high performance fibres was an obvious solution. The concepts proposed therefore used well established high performance fibres and manufacturing methods to fit the requirements of medium to high maturity level and low manufacturing costs stated in the call. It is also expected that IMPSHIELD projects will provide test panels for the IMPTEST project and the following contributions to the Clean Sky programme: -Improved understanding of the efficiency of various impact shielding concepts -Improved understanding of manufacturing of ballistic shields for different environmental conditions -Provide a prototype structure using high performance fibres for use in ballistic shielding on aircraft Project Results: 1. Introduction The main S &amp;amp; T results/foregrounds of the three concepts within the IMPSHIELD projects regarding design and manufacturing of the composite laminates are described in the following text. The laminates, Impact Shields, from these projects are used in the IMPTEST (278368) project where the ballistic performance for the different designs and materials is tested and evaluated. The design of the shields was made from three different projectiles and performed by the subcontractor ICON (Imperial College Consultants). The fibre and resin for each concept is also presented with shield thicknesses and areal weights. The manufacturing, which according to the DoW is a bigger part of the project, was performed by the coordinating research institute Swerea SICOMP AB. 2. IMPSHIELD Design Concept A (Temperature range -55°C – 150°C) This concept requires a medium to high level of maturity of the technology. Also stipulated is the use of a low manufacturing cost of the shield which affects the design concept. 2.1. Initial Design Concept The first design for concept A (proposed in the application) was based on a single laminate with a corrugated dry backing layer. That design concept followed the so-called bi-stable [1] lamination technique in which material gradually activates during the impact event. The key aspects are the front face which slows the projectile. The concept could use novel 7 micron glass fibres, which have indicated an improvement over the mature 9 micron glass fibres. The composite has also been arranged in a novel geometrical configuration which has not been tested as a complete unit. 2.2. Final Design Calculations made by ICON showed that the corrugations will not work unless they are only few millimetres in length, which is not practical for draping the material unless it has a very low dtex and weight, which is assumed to be not possible. Also, the shear locking of the fabric is required to determine the wave length which requires physical tests. Hence the project should proceed with conventional laminate concept with the following properties: S2-glass dry summary Density 2.488g/cm3, E=90GPa, tensile strength= 2.34GPa Airbus projectile: tlam =30mm, Areal weight = 41 kg/m2 Dassault projectile: tlam =14mm, Areal weight = 19 kg/m2 Intermediate projectile: tlam =18mm, Areal weight = 24 kg/m2 2.3. Materials for Impshield A Woven S2 7μm was not possible to get delivered from Hexcel despite the fact that it was a “common style” material in their technical fabric handbook. Hexcel could only supply weaves in 9μm filament diameter. The 7 μm that Imperial College had at Sigmatex was not suitable for the shields since it was quite heavy and with a high dtex. So a 9 μm weave from Hexcel will be used. A PIMC (powder in mould coating) thermoset powder will be used as matrix material. The powder is tested to make a laminate “starved” in a controlled way by adding an amount of powder in between each layer. Application of powder repeatable for each layer will be important and will be made with electrostatic spray and a dispenser combined with thermal adhesion with scale. Curing of powder will probably occur in 150-200°C. Reinforcement: S2 Glass, HexForce® 06781 1270 Z6040 S-2 Glass Fabric (9μm) 8H Satin Weave from Hexcel.

Design Concept Impshield B (Temperature range -55°C – 85°C) The concept in this call requires a medium to high level of maturity of the technology without the necessity of aiming for a low cost manufacturing solution. 3.1. Initial Design Concept The NLR has developed previously developed the so-called ‘tensor skin concept’ [2] using Dyneema layers within an existing laminated composite. The concept was originally developed for a helicopter subfloor structure, and has been applied to meet birdstrike regulations within a composite leading edge. The leading edge skin structure contains a laminate (tensor) with folded loops which unfold on bird impact, effectively catching the bird. The composite skin laminate consists of multiple plies, of which the load-carrying plies transfer the normal operational aerodynamic load to the ribs. These plies therefore provide the usual leading edge skin stiffness. The second group of plies, the tensor plies, contain folded loops between the ribs, which are to unfold when a relatively high lateral load is applied to the skin. Under normal conditions these plies are additionally present without any function. In case of a relatively high lateral load, like a bird impact, all plies except the tensor plies fail. The unfolded plies are comparable to plastic hinges and are loaded in tension like a membrane. When completely unfolded, the vertical load compressively loads the ribs, which are then crushed in a controlled way in order to absorb sufficient bird kinetic energy. These designs were not optimised and do not use the most recent developments in material science, which could potentially produce a step change in the performance. Other concepts also use unfolding ideas, typically the so-called bi-stable [3] lamination technique could be used to activate material gradually during the impact event as an alternative to the corrugation concept. The basic concept consists of UHMWPE prepreg. The appropriate Dyneema for the concept could be HB50, contacts with DSM gave that the recently commercialised HB80 should be better, but unfortunately they were not willingly to supply the material to the project. Contact with Honeywell was taken and they provided materials similar to DSM:s Dyneema. 3.1.1. Shield thickness The thicknesses (mm) for the Airbus, Dassault and Intermediate (A, D and I) projectiles have been estimated based on three analytical methods. Jacobs and Van Dingenen [5] assumed the absorbed energy is proportional to mass below the strike face, while empirical scaling laws have been developed by Cunniff [4]. Dassault Method (11.8mm, 7.6mm and 10.0mm) [based on chart provided by Dassault] Jacobs et al Method (14.9mm, 6.8mm and 9.0mm) [based on HB2 only] Cunniffs Method (12.7mm, 6.2mm and 8.4mm) [for smaller HB26 plate geometry only, but relative velocities similar] 3.2. Final Design The thicknesses calculated by the design team at Honeywell according to the energy absorption and the provided projectile and the composite laminate data are: Airbus projectile: tlam =18.8mm, Areal weight = 18.6 kg/m2 Dassault projectile: tlam =9.5mm, Areal weight = 9.3 kg/m2 Intermediate projectile: tlam =12.8mm, Areal weight = 12.7 kg/m2 The shields are manufactured using a hot-press process at Honeywell in USA and delivered to SICOMP for inspection and analysis before shipping to London. 3.3.

Design Concept Impshield C (Temperature range -55°C – 150°C) This call is for a new concept with a low level of maturity of the technology without the necessity of aiming for a low cost manufacturing solution. 4.1. Initial Design Concept Most fibres can be combined with a resin, either thermoplastic or thermoset, and made into a UD, 2D woven or 3D woven layer or lamina layer. For the 2D and 3D woven architecture potentially different fibre types could be combined within a single layer. A series of layers could be graded in the through thickness direction of the armour, thus using each fibre type to its ‘best’ advantage. During a high-velocity impact event on a composite laminate, the reactions within each layer in the laminate and the response from the layers can vary significantly depending on the location within the laminate. The performance of each layer could therefore be designed and engineered specifically for the observed stress, strain, strain-rate and temperature distributions that occur at these different locations. The possibility of developing new novel high performance hybrid composite systems, which are not unusual in nature for improving performance under various dynamic load conditions; the spider’s web is probably one of the best examples where up to seven different silks with varying properties are used to optimize the performance of the web. Hybridising layers to produce structural armour has been investigated in an ad-hoc fashion in the open literature [6, 7]; however, no modelling was used to understand the behaviour. In the present proposal for the first concept it is proposed to use UD high performance fibre graded in the thickness direction as a cross-ply, typically in thicknesses of ~1-2mm. Between the high performance sub-laminates a foam layer would be used. The distance between the sub-laminates of high performances fibres allow the layers to act in a membrane action more readily. A high temperature thermoset or thermoplastic resin system could be used, however, it should be resin starved. The design calculations shows that it is better to make a base laminate of 5mm and a base core “air” of 10mm (based on the impact pulse duration), rather than changing the laminate and core for each design. Airbus projectile: tlam=25mm (5mm-10mm-5mm-10mm-5mm-10mm-5mm-10mm-5mm) Dassault projectile: tlam=10mm (5mm-10mm-5mm) Intermediate projectile: tlam=15mm (5mm-10mm-5mm-10mm-5mm) 4.2. Final Design The final design is changed at the project meeting in London at Imperial College 3rd of July and the core giving the “air gap” between the laminates is excluded. The laminates will be resin starved in the shooting window and more or less homogenous in the clamping frame area and manufactured at SICOMP using hot-press process. Airbus projectile: tlam=25mm (5mm-5mm-5mm-5mm-5mm), Areal weight = 41 kg/m2 Dassault projectile: tlam=10mm (5mm-5mm), Areal weight = 19 kg/m2 Intermediate projectile: tlam=15mm (5mm-5mm-5mm), Areal weight = 24 kg/m2 4.3.

Titanium plates SICOMP will supply five 300x300x12mm reference plates in Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V).

Holes will be cut in the titanium plates before delivery according to the mounting holes at the test rig. 6. Manufacturing of the shields 6.1. Manufacturing criteria’s for IMPSHIELD A and C The manufacturing processes for A- and C-panels are decided according to the following: a) The reinforcements will not be saturated with matrix No wetting process such as RTM or vacuum infusion is suitable The laminate will contain 3 fundamentals, resin / fibre / air b) Boundary conditions for manufacturing Fixed surface weight at reinforcements Fixed surface weight at adhesive film Designated thickness for the laminates for three different projectiles c) Evenly spread resin through the laminate stacking Minimised saturated areas d) Realistic number of manufacturing steps e) Highest nominal common thickness for the three designs 2 mm for IMPSHIELD A 5 mm for IMPSHIELD C f) Compaction force at reinforcements, “performance” of weaved geometry Geometry of reinforcement will give fibre fraction in Volume vs. compaction pressure Indicates the process window for selected reinforcements Reasonable fibre volume fraction Reasonable compaction forces The compaction tests and the fibre fraction from the shield design gives together with the laminate thicknesses a number of layers for each stack. This is shown in the manufacturing chapters for IMPSHIELD A and C. 7. Manufacturing of IMPSHIELD Panel A The panels for IMPSHIELD A are built up by stacking two millimetre laminates to get the three different shield thicknesses. This is a big advantage for the manufacturing process. 7.1. Process window and number of layers A big help to set up the manufacturing process is the use of a process window (PW). It illustrates a pressure interval, for the specific hot press used, where the manufacturing is most effective. The mould will not be filled to the left of the PW (lower pressure) and it is inefficient to go further to the right of the PW (higher pressure) since the fibre fraction will just be marginally higher. The aim to build two millimetre laminates gives a number of S2 glass weave layers to be inside the process window. Choosing eight layers will put the process in the middle of the process window. The laminates are built up, two side by side, by S2 Glass weave and a resin powder, with more resin in the frame area and less in the “shooting window”. 7.2. Building the stack of reinforcement and matrix a) The S2 glass weave is cut in the cutting machine to the size of two parallel laminates, to make the preform and stacking process more effective. b) The ply stack is built on a warm plate on top on a scale, and the powder matrix is applied to the right weight is reached for each layer. The shooting area is masked for two layers to get the right fibre fraction. c) When the stack has been built it is consolidated with a roll. d) The 700x350mm laminate stack is cut in two halves, 350x350mm before pressing 7.3. Hot pressing the stacks e) The press tool is heated to 150°C and the press force is set to 30 tons f) One Teflon sheet is put on the bottom tool surface g) The two 350x350mm stacks are put into the press tool with 2mm distances around the stacks h) One Teflon sheet is put on top of the laminate stacks and the press is closed i) After 15 minutes the press is opened and the laminates are removed 7.4. Light inspection After the laminates are removed from the press they are weighted and inspected by light to see if there are any major errors and for post testing comparison with pictures in IMPTEST. 7.5. Water jet cutting of outer dimensions and holes The laminates are cut to the right dimension using water jet. The holes to fit into the mounting frame are also cut. 7.6. Stacking the laminates to the three different shield thicknesses When the laminates have got the right dimensions they are stacked together to build the three different shield thicknesses. 7.7. Production rate and cost at SICOMP manufacturing facility In the manufacturing facility at SICOMP 12 mm laminate (350x350mm) per hour is produced and the cost for material (resin and reinforcement) and man time is €20.5 per millimetre laminate. 8. Manufacturing of IMPSHIELD Panel B The B-panels are manufactured by Honeywell due to the fact that some of the data for the materials and the process are under ITAR control or Honeywell proprietary. The manufacturing process is described by Honeywell in the steps below. 8.1. Processing Guidelines for Honeywell Ballistic Materials, Hard Armour Products Honeywell Spectra Shield Hard Armour Products, Compression Moulding Process a) Insert material stack and preheat centreline to 275°F using a panel/part contact pressure less than 200 psi and a platen temperature of 285°F. b) Hold centreline at 275°F for 15 min. (preheat time) under panel/part contact pressure of less than 200 psi. c) Apply 3500 psi as standard pressure on panel/part and hold at 275°F for 15 min (dwell time). d) Initiate cool cycle. e) Cool centreline of material stack to 125°F. f) Release applied tonnage. g) Remove from press. The total Areal density for SR-3136 is given by Honeywell, 257 ± 8g /m2. 8.2. Water jet cutting holes and light inspection The panels delivered to SICOMP are then cut for mounting in the test rig according to the drawing provided by Imperial College Consultants (ICON). The panels are also inspected with light before delivery to ICON and for post testing comparison with pictures in IMPTEST. 8.3. Optical fibre fraction control Since fibre fraction data is unavailable from Honeywell, due to ITAR control and Honeywell proprietary, optical inspections at SICOMP give the volume fibre fraction, Vf, for the panels to 69.5%. 8.4. Production cost for Honeywell panels The cost for the laminates from Honeywell is approximately €23 per millimetre laminate (300x300mm) from what is ordered for phase one testing, i.e. five laminates of each concept. The order for phase two (and three), ten respectively fifteen panels of the two remaining concepts gives a cost of €11 per millimetre. 9. Manufacturing of IMPSHIELD Panel C The panels for shield C are built up by stacking five millimetre laminates to the three different shield thicknesses. This is a big advantage for the manufacturing process. The laminates are built up by aramid weave and epoxy resin film with more resin in the frame area and less in the “shooting window”. 9.1. Process window and number of layers A big help to set up the manufacturing process is the use of a process window (PW). It illustrates a pressure interval, for the specific hot press used, where the manufacturing is most effective. The mould will not be filled to the left of the PW (lower pressure) and it is inefficient to go further to the right of the PW (higher pressure) since the fibre fraction will just be marginally higher. The aim to build five millimetre laminates gives a number of aramid weave layers to be inside the process window. Choosing ten layers will put the process in the middle of the process window. 9.2. Building the stack of reinforcement and matrix a) The aramid weave and resin film are cut and put into separate piles aa) Ten weaves are put in each pile and weighted bb The resin film stripes and sheets are just put in two separate piles b) Five layers with complete resin film coverage are made; plastic protective film is first removed c) Four layers with stripes of resin film on both sides of the aramid weave in the frame area are made; plastic protective film is first removed d) One layer with stripes of resin film on one side of the aramid weave in the frame area is made, plastic protective film is first removed e) The ten plys are placed on a 50°C warm plate and individually rolled to get the resin film into the weave, consolidation. f) The pile of ten plys is the put into the freezer, to ease the removal of the protective paper g) Ply by ply is then taken out from the freezer and put together in the right order after removing the protective paper from the resin film h) The finished stack of ten plys is weighted 9.3. Hot pressing the stacks a) The press tool is heated to 150°C and the press force is set to 30 tons b) One Teflon sheet is put on the bottom tool surface c) Two stacks are put onto the bottom tool d) Five millimetre distance plates are put onto the bottom tool around the stacks e) One Teflon sheet is put on top of the stacks f) The tool is closed and the press holds the force for 15minutes g) The tool is opened and the laminates are removed and put onto a 50°C plate for cooling h) The laminates are weighted after cooling 9.4. Light inspection After the laminates are weighted they are inspected by light to see if there are any major errors and for post testing comparison with pictures in IMPTEST. 9.5. Water jet cutting holes and outer dimensions The laminates are cut to the right dimension using water jet. The holes to fit into the mounting frame are also cut. 9.6. Stacking the laminates to the three different shield thicknesses After the water jet the laminates are dried in an oven at 70°C to remove any extra humidity in the laminates from the cutting and then stacked together for the three different configurations. 9.7. Production rate and cost at SICOMP manufacturing facility In the manufacturing facility at SICOMP 15 mm laminate (350x350mm) per hour is produced and the cost for material (resin and reinforcement) and man time is €25 per millimetre laminate. Potential Impact: Since the aim of the Clean Sky initiative is to provide radically greener air transport based on novel concepts for engines and aircraft design. In this way Clean Sky is expected to provide major steps towards the environmental goals for aviation in 2020 set out by ACARE. Within Clean Sky the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) ITD will specifically consider the use of these novel concepts for a new aircraft configuration. The impact shields designed within the IMPSHIELD projects will provide the basis for the shielding structures that will be incorporated in aircraft structures. The development of manufacturing methods for the concepts means a methodology of producing the shields has been tested allowing high technology readiness levels of the shields for industrial implementation. During the design phase it has been learned that design concepts working for larger impact specimens with other weights and velocities did not work for the projectiles in these projects From the manufacturing work in the project it was learned how to manufacture panels with resin starved areas using an electrostatic spray-gun in the process. And lessons have also been learned on how to produce a lot of laminates by hand in an ergonomic and effective way. The focus in the project has been to design and manufacture the shields for the IMPTEST project. All the dissemination effort was planned to come from the IMPTEST project with some input from the IMPSHIELD project.

       "Did someone call for a physicist? Bartosz Rozycki, a Marie Curie fellow, currently based at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Germany, is trying to bridge that gap. Rozycki’s background is in theoretical physics, which he studied first in his native Poland, and then in Germany and at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA. As a student he got interested in biology, and he is now using his specialist knowledge to probe deeper than ever before into some of these most challenging of protein structures. Rozycki is particularly interested in the lengthily-named Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT for short), a protein complex of more than 2,000 amino acids, consisting of tightly-defined regions connected by stringy peptide loops. The ESCRT sorts proteins expressed on cells’ surfaces into particular vesicles, which Rozycki calls the “trash cans of the cell.” Periodically, these proteins get damaged or need to be swapped, so the ESCRT sorts out the chaff, packages it into vesicles and sends them off to be metabolised. That might sound like a pretty complex task for an inanimate protein to do – and it is. Scientists have been puzzling over how the packaging up process works for some time, but without knowing the structure of ESCRT they can only make guesses. What is more, ESCRT is a protein complex known to be hi-jacked by envelope viruses like HIV when, having done their dastardly work, they need to make an exit from a cell. They cannot escape from the cell without a disguise, and so they use ESCRT to package themselves into vesicles which can bud out from the cell membrane unnoticed. Again, if scientists could unravel the mechanisms, new insights into the disease pathways could be unveiled and new therapeutic strategies envisaged.&quot;&gt;The proteins that are the most difficult to evaluate structurally are those which have several large, well-structured units connected by flexible linking strands.

       "Current costs for industrial wastewater treatment in Europe are already an economic burden and are expected to rise. The costs are restricting the growth of the European production sector, especially in water scarce areas where there is a pressing need to reuse water. OxFloc aims to reduce treatment costs while offering modular installation and application engineering at a price below comparable State-of-the-Art processes. OxFloc systems have a quantifiable superior environmental benefit, a smaller plant footprint, lower operation costs, and enable water recycling. Not all industrial wastewaters are the same, but many carry a mix of chemicals and non-biodegradable components e.g. tensides, flame resistants, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and heavy metals. Therefore, industrial effluents need significant treatment before they can be discharged to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Typically the pollutants exist with suspended particles, requiring a clearing pretreatment which increases cost and energy consumption of current treatments. Our system solves this problem by combining particle removal and adsorption with advanced oxidation. Our OxFloc system is a combined flocculation-oxidation process that needs few chemicals because of the electrolytic production of iron ions as catalyst and flocculant, as well as of hydrogen peroxide, takes place in the reactor itself. It is an integrated system capable of degrading and removing both dissolved and suspended harmful substances from industrial wastewaters using only electrical energy. It is fully compatible with power from renewable energy sources, conventional supply or from smartpower grids balancing supply and demand of electrical energy.\n",

       "Through the adoption of the OxFloc apparatus there could be a significant societal benefit through the reduction of pollution from different kinds of industrial wastewater by improved treatment. The consortium decided to test the technology firstly with landfill leachate. Some toxic organic compounds in landfill leachate are inhibitory to the biological processes at water treatment plants. Raw leachate also contains recalcitrant organic substances that are not degraded during biological treatment at water treatment works.

The costs are restricting the growth of the European production sector, especially in water scarce areas where there is a pressing need to reuse water. OxFloc aims to reduce treatment costs while offering modular installation and application engineering at a price below comparable State-of-the-Art processes. OxFloc systems have a quantifiable superior environmental benefit, a smaller plant footprint, lower operation costs, and enable water recycling. Not all industrial wastewaters are the same, but many carry a mix of chemicals and non-biodegradable components e.g. tensides, flame resistants, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and heavy metals. Therefore, industrial effluents need significant treatment before they can be discharged to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Typically the pollutants exist with suspended particles, requiring a clearing pretreatment which increases cost and energy consumption of current treatments. Our system solves this problem by combining particle removal and adsorption with advanced oxidation. Our OxFloc system is a combined flocculation-oxidation process that needs few chemicals because of the electrolytic production of iron ions as catalyst and flocculant, as well as of hydrogen peroxide, takes place in the reactor itself. It is an integrated system capable of degrading and removing both dissolved and suspended harmful substances from industrial wastewaters using only electrical energy. It is fully compatible with power from renewable energy sources, conventional supply or from smartpower grids balancing supply and demand of electrical energy. OxFloc involved the generation of new knowledge, the transfer to and assimilation of this knowledge by our SME partnership and then, the post-project exploitation of this new knowledge by the SME partners, who own it collectively. The SME partnership constitutes a supply chain for the production and sales of the OxFloc technology. Work performed Since the beginning of the project the project partners have built a team of specialists tackling the individual tasks. The oxidative process and adsorptive process were characterized. Oxidative process characterization Starting from literature values the oxidative process was parameterized and experiments were performed on different organic pollutants selected as model pollutants (e.g. phenol and diclofenac). Further landfill leachate was selected as both synthetic and real wastewater. Conductivity, pH and current density were varied amongst other parameters. Optimal operational conditions for the oxidative process were determined by means of the experiments performed. Adsorptive process characterization The adsorptive process was characterized by building on review of current literature. Influencing parameters were identified and the range to be investigated determined. Experiments with synthetic and real landfill leachate were performed. Experiments allowed the selection of optimal operational conditions. Finally both processes were coupled. The results allowed the development of our design concept for the OxFloc 50 l/h prototype which treated synthetic and real landfill leachate by combined electrocoagulation and electro-fenton with most promising results.

       "The aim of CHARISMA was to build a new user-friendly platform of existing large-scale facilities or small/medium installations open to users and develop a set of the widest number of scientific methodologies and techniques, in order to enable the European heritage science community to gain improvement in the research for diagnostics, analysis and assessment of materials of cultural heritage, identification of artistic techniques, identification of the cause and effects of deterioration processes, and in situ monitoring during and after restoration.\n",
       "Long term objectives were: improve the infrastructure relationships and counteract the fragmentation in scattered scientific communities of the wide range of activities, integrate the research capacities across Europe and beyond, capitalising on the resources and expertise to foster and enlarge the user community, diffuse awareness at the scientific and decision making level of the vision and results of CHARISMA.  \n",
       "Significant achieved results have been:\n",
       "• The deployment of functioning access nodes of the most advanced European facilities customized to meet the particular heritage requirements for research and applications on composition and structure of works of art, the technology used to produce them, the alteration of their materials in specific environmental conditions – including museums –, the establishment of possible remedies against deterioration, etc.;\n",
       "• The set up of high performance analytical equipment, for in-situ non-invasive measurements on artworks, without any movement of the artefacts from their location, permitting for a direct materials research on precious or immovable artworks, or monitoring innovative conservation methodologies during their application, even on the scaffolding at a restoration site;\n",

       "•\tContext\n",
       "Ancient and historical masterpieces are often exposed to the harmful effects of a changing environment or inappropriate restoration or handling, so that tangible cultural heritage can be intrinsically unstable. Many risks can be mitigated so long as proper knowledge of materials and degradation processes has been acquired. In fact, the detailed knowledge of the composition or structure of an artwork or an archaeological artefact is a prerequisite condition for any research in art history or archaeology as well as any action of conservation-restoration. This is crucial for decisions on proper preservation actions and undeniably requires an assessment of the foreseeable evolution of the degradation. To gain the deepest insight into the artwork properties, museums curators, conservators and heritage scientists should benefit from access to research tools of the highest level and to the most skilled teams able to take advantage of the outstanding possibilities of the corresponding micro-analytical tools.\n",
       "Due to their origin and ageing, heritage materials are generally mixtures of inorganic phases (crystalline or amorphous) and organic compounds (often at the micro- and nanoscale), which require powerful analytical tools to be identified. Mapping of constituents is now essential in view of the heterogeneous nature of heritage materials at all scales: it involves not only the distribution of elemental composition, but also of crystal structures, molecular signatures, etc. A large variety of advanced techniques – portable or microinvasive – is used nowadays, from laser to synchrotron and ion beams, from microfocussed spectroscopy to full-field imaging. Regarding conservation methodologies, laser technology has recently offered new solutions to the complex problems of cleaning dirt encrusted artefacts, this in spite of the complexity of the physicochemical risks associated with the ablation of photosensitive substrates and the limited opportunities for testing on real cases.\n",
       "Within this general frame, the lack of a coherent powerful platform of access to the widest number of scientific methodologies and techniques available in large scale facilities and small/medium installations, as well as the difficulty of sustaining coherent combined experimental strategies, have been in the past significant limiting factors to a rapid development of the European research.\n",
       "To close this gap, CHARISMA (Cultural Heritage Advanced Research Infrastructures: Synergy for a Multidisciplinary Approach to Conservation/ Restoration) has been established as an FP7 EU-funded advanced Research Infrastructures consortium, which integrates conservation/restoration scientific activities and transnational access, whose activities, developed within the period from October 2009 to March 2014, are reported in this document.\n",
       "\n",
       "•\tObjectives \n",
       "The aim of CHARISMA was to build a new, user-friendly platform based on a combination of the most relevant existing instruments, knowledge and stored data collections. The results must be capable of performing the necessary applications enabling the heritage science community answer complex questions related to i) diagnostics; ii) analysis and assessment of materials of artworks; iii) identification of artistic techniques; iv) identification of the cause and effects of deterioration processes; v) in-situ monitoring of conservation processes during and after treatments. \n",
       "•\tMain goals: \n",
       "• Provide the best opportunity for developing research at the forefront of the field, combining advanced scientific research infrastructures with the high-level knowledge of leading technology institutes on cultural heritage.\n",
       "• Couple cutting-edge research to intelligent delivery systems through interaction with end-users and experts in science applied to cultural heritage disciplines.\n",
       "• Optimize the use of infrastructures through a coordinated program of transnational access, joint research, and networking activities.\n",
       "• Overcome the lack of a coherent powerful platform of access to the widest number of scientific techniques available in large scale installations and small/medium facilities, sustaining combined experimental strategies.\n",
       "At the EU heritage science scale:\n",
       "• Develop a common accessible platform offering users the most advanced European facilities embedded in a complementary and multidisciplinary environment involving material science and artwork conservation/restoration.\n",
       "• Create a solid base for outstanding innovation in the capacity-building policies of science and technology, with expert knowledge on the most significant advances for safeguarding and protecting cultural heritage, enhancing the project openness across Europe and beyond.\n",
       "• Hold a program of open workshops and training to introduce curators, research-conservators and conservation scientists to the questions involved.\n",
       "• Promote a joint reflection work and share the best practice for multi-technique analysis of samples, analytical data assessment or degradation issues as well as knowledge on large scale conservation projects.\n",
       "Scientific and Technological Views:\n",
       "• Design and set-up innovative instrumentations, for in-situ 2D and 3D examinations of artworks, and new cleaning techniques based on laser technology.\n",
       "• Improve access to databases exploiting digitalization of data and their harmonization.\n",
       "• Carry out research on dyestuff identification to further elucidate the composition and behaviour of organic colorants.\n",
       "• Develop patterning and orientation techniques and new methodologies for the study of organic materials and their distribution in micro-samples or directly at the surface of the object.\n",
       "The challenges facing CHARISMA embrace transnational access, joint research and networking activities.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.1 Networking \n",
       "The powerful advances in research over the last few years have coincided with a growth and spread of a culture of cooperation among European scientists, with an increase in the awareness of the crucial importance of sharing of knowledge, pooling of resources, and coordination of activities over the European area. Initiatives such as the Eu-ARTECH project, funded within the 6th FP, and others as European standardisation in cultural heritage, CEN TC/346, strongly hinted at this cultural development. CHARISMA strongly contributed to improve interoperability among the institutions of the consortium and those external to it, diffusing best practices and, at a more fundamental level, knowledge of new instrumentation, methods and technologies.\n",
       "During the projects years a progressive harmonization/compatibility was adopted of best protocols for multi-technique analysis of samples, following the type of object and material (stone, metal, paint, paper, polymers, etc.) or degradation issue (alterations, depositions) and in diagnosis and conservation methodology for monuments, historical buildings and sites. A uniform protocol for sharing analytical data of individual archives and registers (distributed data sets or database systems or different digital formats) was also completed.\n",
       "A detailed training plan has been developed to allow the cultural heritage community to benefit from the assembled scientific excellence through the organization of training events, seminars, &quot;hands on&quot; workshops to diffuse deep knowledge, expertise and well established methodologies to the users / professionals and to the public.\n",
       "To coordinate the compatibility of CHARISMA with related initiatives worldwide, to disseminate information about the project, its objectives and results, spreading internal and external communication trough the establishnent of target audiences, have been all other goals successful accomplished, creating two-way communication channels with stakeholders carrying national responsibilities, academic, research and conservators’ communities and users benefiting from project activities.\n",
       "Coordination fruitful activities included:\n",
       "- Share and compare the results obtained by European scientific community on focused priority areas, verify the impact of project work and grades through focused technical meetings and ensure the highest efficiency of the developed activities and verify that they correspond to the real users’ needs.\n",
       "- Implement the CHARISMA web site with a relevant dedicated Welcome access section, to apply for access, define and implement, in a coherent way, unified modality of access, the outreach of new users and the site review procedure. Brochures, project Logo, project Fliers etc. were also produced.\n",
       "-Monitor the success and impact of the project activities through the Extra-Mural Advisory Committee, having external feedbacks regarding the project objectives, its technical goals, milestones and deliverables\n",
       "-The delivery of the ‘Definition of quality control procedures’, so-called project reference book, a common procedural document, designed and developed to ensure a ready reference meant for the quality project assurance and the dissemination activities, including publications and presentations. For optimal use, the reference book was produced at the beginning of the project, and shared among partners.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.2 TA Support\n",
       "The CHARISMA engagement offered to European researchers and professionals, a full access service - using an easy single entry point on-line - to the most advanced infrastructures and technologies for investigations on cultural heritage.\n",
       "For applying to techniques devoted to non-destructive examination of objects and samples (FIXLAB) the access was executed at two strongly integrated platforms, one in France (SOLEIL, CNRS) and the other in Hungary (ATOMKI-HAS, BNC), where Large Scale Facilities (LSF) were coupled to a set of medium scale instrumentations, completed when necessary with more conventional examination and analysis tools.\n",
       "The access to the mobile equipment of MOLAB, a unique set of portable instruments and associated competences, allowed researchers to carry out their work on-site, i.e. directly in a conservation laboratory, in a museum room or even on scaffolding in a restoration site.\n",
       "Basically, the equipment consisted of a new high-resolution VIS-NIR multispectral imaging device; a compact, portable XRD-XRF device, for in-situ XRD measurements on identification of crystalline solids; a miniaturised fibre-optic micro-Raman spectrometer, equipped with two lasers (532 and 785 nm) for the study of glasses and glazes, pigments and colorants; a prototypical spectro-fluorimeter for the in-situ measurements of fluorescence lifetimes in the scale of picoseconds, unique for its portability; as well as other additional compact portable advanced tools based on other chemical and physical techniques.\n",
       "These services were integrated with ARCHLAB, a “facility” enabling access to the huge quantity of archived knowledge and technical data held in the most prestigious European museums or conservation institutes recognised from France, UK, Italy Spain and Netherlands (namely: British Museum, UK; C2RMF/Palais du Louvre, FR; Museo del Prado, ES; Opificio delle Pietre Dure, IT; Agency for Research in Cultural Heritage, NL, and National Gallery of London, UK. These archives assemble analytical and technical data on paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, metals, etc., collected over many years of activities devoted to the analysis and studies for the scientific conservation and safeguard of cultural heritage. These archives have been through CHARISMA, for the first time, accessible to European scientists, engineers and technologists, together with art historian, archaeologists and conservator-restores, allowing the data held within them to be used in new ways.\n",
       "ARCHLAB, MOLAB and FIXLAB therefore covered the whole range of needs from the in situ studies on artworks, to the most advanced micro-analytical laboratory techniques for bulk, surface and stratigraphic investigations, to the access to stored knowledge and technical data. Their coupling allowed users to successfully combine a wide range of analytical facilities, for non-invasive and micro-invasive measurements, taking into account the particular issues of cultural heritage regarding security, insurance and transportation. The support to this novel investigation strategy was at the heart of CHARISMA transnational access activities (TNA).\n",
       "\n",
       "2.3  Joint research\n",
       "The activity was addressed to extend the novel instrumental areas and to push their capabilities to the cutting edge of research, following the users’ requirements and the current needs of the research community, aiming at the development of:\n",
       "• Portable equipment for 3D in-situ examination of artworks, for integrated absorption-fluorescence- decay time measurements on fluorescing substances in the UV-Vis range and on novel cleaning methodologies;\n",
       "• Chemically oriented research for emerging innovative lab methodologies for the study of organic material distributions in cross sections or in the identification of dyes and their deterioration products/pathways, possibly as a function of their nature and provenance.\n",
       "The application of multispectral imaging and spectroscopy to the study of the distribution of organic and inorganic materials in art objects was also explored;\n",
       "• New methods to access and integrate existing heritage records and protocols should enable available data and knowledge to be made more readily available to cultural heritage professionals in a user-friendly, integrated and effective way, allowing direct exchange and comparison of data to be exploited.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.4  Project’s team combined efforts (Beneficiaries List)  \n",
       "•\tThe Consortium\n",
       "The project beneficiaries, 22 of the most internationally well-known European institutions in the field of cultural heritage, cooperated to provide cultural institutions, SMEs, laboratories and researchers with new opportunities and technical developments with instruments, parameters and guidelines for carrying out their work, improving, at the same time their knowledge/proficiency/competencies.

       "• Project Bodies Functioning. Two bodies were in charge of project management, helping the Coordinator: i) the CHARISMA Governing Board with all beneficiaries (GB) and  ii) the Steering Committee (SC) with all the WP Leaders. All rules of governance were set out in the Consortium Agreement, regulating mutual relations and rights among participants and vis-à-vis the European Commission. The CA defined decision-making procedures, methods for reviewing the technical work, the settlement of internal disputes and the distribution of the EC grant. \n",
       "A meetings’ plan was agreed among partners to ensure that all partners took part to the program according to their role and responsibilities. A beneficiary in turn hosted the General or Interim meeting with a six-month cadence, taking care of the logistics and organisation. APRE supported the Coordinator in the definition of the agenda and in the collection of presentations by the partners. Minutes have been collected, distributed to partners and published in the Intranet website.\n",
       "• Communication with the European Commission. UNIPG, Coordinator, has been the intermediary for any communication between the EC and partners during the project period.\n",
       "• Administration of the financial contribution. The Community financial contribution was carefully managed regarding its allocation among partners, in accordance with the GA, the Consortium Agreement and the decisions taken by the consortium, informing the Commission. At the end of each period the Partners’ Financial Reports have been collected, giving homogeneity to all the information provided by the partners both in terms of content and editing; ensuring consistency between the expenses claimed by the partners and the activity performed. FAQ, general provisions governing the role and responsibilities of the partners, financial and contractual aspects were also implemented.\n",
       "• Quality assurance. The Steering Committee was in charge of evaluating technical progress, reviewing and assessing the project results, feedback of the results into redefinition of the project operational goals, and overall coherence. In this role, the SC was charged of project quality control and the status of each work package, ensuring the high quality of the data sets generated. \n",
       "The so-called project reference book ‘Definition of quality control procedures’ was implemented during the first year of the project, as a common procedural document, for the quality project assurance and the dissemination activities, including publications and presentations. \n",
       "• Communication and Reporting. During the project, the tasks of preparing, binding and sending the periodical Reports and the generated technical documentation have been exchanged in electronic format and made available to partners. To monitor the status of the planned project deliverables, internal reports have been prepared every four months. A mailing list service has been developed.  \n",
       "To enhance and facilitate the reporting process to the EC, a Reporting Tool system, especially produced, was stored in Intranet and rendered available to partners. Appropriate exchange of information with beneficiaries has been ensured through specific meetings. Evaluating, binding and sending the periodical Reports and Annexes was also ensured. \n",
       "• Knowledge management. Matters related to confidentiality and intellectual property right issues handling have been defined in the Consortium Agreement and monitored by the Steering Committee along the project. \n",
       "•\tMain results achieved \n",
       "• The ‘Quality project handbook’, comprehensive of working tools describing the processes in place for the CHARISMA consortium, addressed in particular the issue of how to manage and monitor the project quality to develop and implement a process baseline, on which the Steering Committee monitored the project progress, stage by stage.\n",
       "• The ‘Report template and guidance’ was intended to help the project partners to prepare the project Periodic Reports, to be submitted to the Commission (M18,36,54), detailing the level of information required to WP Leaders/Beneficiaries for the description of the technical and scientific work carried out insofar. Furthermore, following the decision taken by the Steering Committee each beneficiary was required to submit to the Coordinator an Internal Intermediate Progress Reports. \n",
       "• The survey on monitoring the project’ Deliverables and Milestones status on a six months basis helped for the assessment of the work due in the period. This procedure was part of the Steering Committee responsibility together with the scientific quality check, the supervision and evaluation of the project technical progress and the revision of the project results. In this role, the SC  has been in charge of the project global critical path, the scientific review of the work performed by the partners, including the degree of fulfilment of the objectives  of the period, and the status of each work package outputs. Eight ‘Periodic status checks reports’ were provided during the project at M6, M11, M17 M24, M30, M36, M42 and M48, before the Steering Committee concerned meetings.\n",

       "WP2 had the overall objective of exchanging knowledge and expertise within and outside the consortium in certain key areas of mutual interest among the partners, to establish common protocols, and to increase awareness of current best practice and latest developments, with the ultimate aim of raising general standards in the field of science applied to cultural heritage over Europe as a whole. \n",
       "The two tasks addressed targeted areas of current relevance and complementary to tasks in other CHARISMA joint research and access WPs. The first task concentrated on best practices, principles and protocols, the two chosen areas of focus being firstly the methodology for technical examination of paintings and painted objects (especially sample preparation and methodology for use of multiple complementary techniques); and secondly evaluation of methodology and scientific techniques for monitoring and diagnosis directed towards conservation of historical buildings and sites. \n",
       "Many different methods of technical examination are now used on works of art, depending on the questions being investigated and the type of object, but also on the facilities available in different laboratories. These are in a state of continuous development and improvement. Task 1a took advantage of the fact that CHARISMA included major laboratories in this field by carrying out a survey of practice in technical examination of paintings and painted objects across Europe. \n",
       "Task 1b also addressed best practice in technical examination, but instead applied to problem-solving and decision-making during large-scale conservation projects across Europe for monuments, historical buildings and sites. Working groups were formed for four main categories– stone, stained glass, metals, and wall paintings. The main achievement was the formulation of an assessment of the current state of the field, new developments and guidelines on best practice in the diagnosis and monitoring of the various materials found in historic building and sites. This took the form of a series of flowcharts indicating appropriate methodology for different materials, with additional commentary, presented in the deliverable D2.4 Estimation principles for planning and implementation of conservation projects in selected categories of monuments and historical buildings. As with Task 1a, a parallel practical exercise was organised. The workshop held at the former Cistercian Abbey of Chaalis, near Paris (24-25 Nov 2013), served as a direct means of exchanging information and opinions on the capabilities and relevance of various diagnostic techniques, in order to form a consensus on their place in the methodological flowcharts. Some of the new techniques being developed in WP9 were included in this workshop, so that potential applications of these new instruments could be explored.\n",
       "The second task in WP2 was focused on a different, but also very topical, area – exchange and integration of data generated during scientific examination. This is important to allow sharing as well as archiving, and is becoming increasingly relevant as initiatives develop for online databases that allow advances in searching and re-using the information, which in the future offer the prospect of more efficient use of the data as a research resource.\n",
       "Subtask 2b was more general in approach, addressing integration of the wide range of data and images and related historical metadata generated during technical study of any cultural heritage object. \n",
       "Importantly, it was demonstrated that although there is a common general strategy for the combination of different complementary techniques in the investigation of cultural heritage, there are neither common practices nor universal protocols for integration of the data, nor for organization of metadata. It is clear there is great potential for further development in this area, and a most significant outcome of this task was identification of actual needs and directions of common interest that could be used as a basis for formulating research priorities in this area in the future.\n",
       "•\tMain results achieved \n",
       "• The first main success of this task was a comprehensive review of current methods and new developments. Deliverable D2.1-1 was a substantial report on the results, made available on the project website. It included specifically:\n",
       "a) A detailed summary of practice among project partners for sampling methodology and practice for all types of painting (canvas, panel, wall etc.) and painted objects. \n",
       "b) A literature survey on general paint sample preparation, and needs for various FTIR techniques (synergistic with practical experiments in WP10) and promising new methods.\n",
       "• The work for the second deliverable D2.1-2 in Task 2.1a built on the first deliverable by concentrating on complementary strategies for analysis of samples with multiple techniques, and on sample preparation, a subject of current interest since many newer chemical imaging methods are demanding in this respect. In addition, sampling from precious cultural heritage objects must be limited, so it is particularly valuable to establish effective methodologies, and yet this is a subject not often dealt with in the scientific literature. In the deliverable, guidelines for appropriate methodologies and the results of detailed comparisons of different mounting and polishing methods for samples were presented. The combined results form a valuable resource for describing best practice and considering future priorities.\n",
       "• A highly successful complementary action was the event at SOLEIL synchrotron: Methodology in practice: hands-on workshop on sample preparation and methodology for FTIR analysis. This allowed practical knowledge exchange to be carried out on sample preparation for FTIR, ultimately also useful for SOLEIL FTIR beamline users via FIXLAB (WP7). Samples were prepared in different ways and the effect on FTIR in various modes tested: transmission, reflectance, transflectance or ATR – in the lab or on SMIS synchrotron beamline.\n",
       "• Analytical data are often generated in proprietary formats that do not allow easy interchange. The main achievement of Task 2a was a detailed review of current data standards aimed at constructing guidelines on suitable platform-independent file formats for a range of 2D and 3D data to allow sharing. The focus was on dyestuff analysis as a case study, since a practical need arose during WP10.2 for exchange of this data. The review outlined the need for software development to facilitate exchange of scientific cultural heritage data, and describes the functionality that would be required of such a tool\n",
       "• The evaluation and survey of existing software tools for data integration and documentation (inside and outside CHARISMA), described in deliverable D2.2-2, constitutes an important assessment of the general approach and specific practices or tools that are adopted for effective documentation and integration of analytical and imaging data acquired on cultural heritage materials and objects. In addition, a practical exercise on documentation and integration of the results of the WP9 round robin exercise using MediaWiki, proved useful in considering the needs and format of digital online tools for presenting analyses from multiple techniques. \n",
       "Both actions well served the aims of the task, which were to exchange information on specific digital documentation practices adopted by each CHARISMA partner, to raise awareness of good practice, and to bring together a review of the approaches and protocols in use in important European laboratories for integration, visualisation/presentation and interpretation of results from multiple analytical methods, as an example of best practice and to work towards adopting common protocols to allow more effective exchange of results. \n",

       "Scientific excellence (WP3) was pursued through focused training actions and skills development in favour of CHARISMA end-user in focused priority areas, as well with sharing in scientific and technical meetings the results obtained with the European scientific community, verifying the impact of CHARISMA. The deep knowledge on materials and their behaviour, as well as on best approaches in evaluating their conditions and the selection of the best conservation procedures, has been diffused through the organisation of training events, seminars or workshops. Aim of such events was to train and engage researcher(s) in discussion with professionals (conservator-restorers, conservation-scientists and museum curators) on the appropriate application of the most advanced and novel analytical techniques and conservation methodologies. The WP highlighted also the use of expert technical meetings to disseminate a large fraction of CHARISMA’s principal findings. \n",
       "Three tasks, articulated into subtasks were foreseen. \n",
       "Task 1 “Sharing of resources and oriented-training on advanced instrumentation” [Resp.: NCU]. \n",
       "This task had the aim to offer researchers new opportunities to benefit from immediate and direct experience with new technological acquisitions and prototypes within the consortium, enhancing the possibilities for young scientists in establishing new research programmes. Trainings were also dedicated to professionals and new users external to the consortium on well established analytical/documentation techniques (NMR, laser-based techniques, OCT, etc.) or on the new investigation techniques and related technologies offered by prototypes. \n",
       "Each training event was under the responsibility of one CHARISMA partner, however, each event include other partners interested in the theme and able to cover topics and/or co-finance the course.\n",
       "Task 2 Sharing knowledge and oriented-training on advanced methodologies [Resp.: UNIB]).  \n",
       "With the aim to support a better comprehension of the potentialities of innovative advanced methodologies among researchers of institutions external to the consortium, training activities and/or exchange of visits on problem solving approaches in conservation of paintings, books, buildings, dyestuffs, organic materials, etc. using advanced analytical techniques have been carried out. As for the previous task, behind the CHARISMA partner responsible of the organisation, each event included the active participation of other interested consortium members, that actively cooperated in lecturing, preparing notes, and in other tasks, also co-financing the course, if necessary. \n",
       "Task 3 Oriented-topics events [Resp.: NGL].\n",
       "During the project, four technical meetings or thematic workshops on defined topics have been planned and/or organised. The objective was to verify the impact of CHARISMA work and grades. The workshops have been also an opportunity to share and compare the results obtained by European scientific community on focused priority areas in collaboration of the joint research programme. Main topics were: (i) Advances in a specific analytical field (technique applied on different materials and objects; sampling and sample preparation); (ii) Foresight studies for new instrumentation and technologies; (iii) A group of objects of one period / one style / one (painter) creator/ one (painting) technique. The events have been open to internal and external experts and to the professionals and users. Three of these events led to the publication of proceedings.\n",
       "•\tMain results achieved \n",
       "• Training courses, seminars, “hands on” workshops have been organised, to diffuse deep knowledge - expertise – and well established methodologies to the users / professionals and to the general public (see the following tables and the paragraph Dissemination activities in the Section  Potential impact).\n",
       "• The highest efficiency of the developed activities was ensured, verifying that they correspond to the real users’ needs, in order to turn the assembled scientific excellence to the advantage of the cultural heritage community.\n",
       "• The results obtained by European scientific community on focused priority areas were shared and compared, verifying the impact of the CHARISMA work and grades through technical meetings and workshop.

       "Numerous expressions of interest were given to exchange expertise and to collaborate with CHARISMA from European countries external to the EU and overseas countries, including South America, United States, and Mexico.\n",
       "As part of the objectives for the project in order to extend the project scenario, and following several relevant requests coming from European or worldwide organisations, the Steering Committee approved the Associate Partners by means of a Letter of Intent available on the project web. Agreements have been established with Brazilian Associations and Institutes of Conservators-Restorers, as the Associação Brasileira de Conservadores e Restauradores de Bens Culturais (ABRACOR), and the Laboratorio de Ciencia da Conservação – Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (LACICOR). The association process was successful completed also for the University of Antwerp, BE, Pisa, Torino, Verona and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston, US, the Institute of Protection of Cultural Heritage of Slovenia, Lubljana, SL, the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico, Instituto de Fisica, Mexico City, MX, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, UK, and the Academy of Fine Arts of Prague, CZ. \n",
       "Associate Partners gave inputs (advice, best practices, statistical data, workshop organisation, etc.) contributing with their know-how to the project’s specific workpackage targets.

       "•\tA  Database Target Users\n",
       "An Address Database (AD) was available to the project, starting from the list coming from the previous infrastructures’ EU-ARTECH project data. The AD implemented primarily involving the selected researchers/ professionals/ SMEs/ labs of the cultural heritage community with whom CHARISMA members previously collaborated and currently cooperate. A high number of data have been inserted (more than 1000 records). \n",
       "•\tGet Involved\n",
       "An open invitation to link to the project was implemented through the CHARISMA web site home page (Get Involved). It consisted of a user interest check page, that invited on-line registration (name, organisation, e-mail). Registered motivated people, were included in the AD mailing list for specific dissemination activities. The section, (closed at the end of the project) allowed individuals showing interest toward the project, to receive proper information about the open access calls and CHARISMA issues (events, job announcements, breakthrough results, etc.) permitting them to propose information of news or events of interest to specialists.\n",
       "•\tFriends EC projects &amp; initiatives \n",
       "Following suggestions of the CHARISMA EC Scientific Officer, a number of Coordinators of other EC-supported projects or initiatives in the field of cultural heritage have been contacted. Special efforts have been made to achieve active collaboration with 3D-COFORM, POPART, STACHEM, NET-HERITAGE, DC-NET, DASISH, EuNamus, ECTP FACH and DARIAH (CHARISMA became affiliate project of DARIAH). \n",
       "In addition, a profitable collaboration with CEN TC/346 (developing European, EN standards for conservation) was established.\n",
       "•\tScientific workshops and conferences \n",
       "Traditional channels of communication of the most advanced scientific achievements, such as presentations at scientific workshops and conferences, was also one of the pillars of the consortium dissemination activity. \n",
       "During the project, the dissemination activities have been the subject of Coordinator and WP Leaders’ invited conferences, with the objective to distribute general information on CHARISMA - at the service of the project as a whole - raising the project awareness, diffusing its goals, and enhancing the interest of potential users. In addition, the project beneficiaries participated in many meetings and international conferences related with CHARISMA topics. At these meetings, the primary results of the project activities were presented, underlining the FP7 support of the European Commission. \n",
       "Complementing this, papers were written and presentations at oriented seminars and conferences were carried out. (see the List of dissemination activities).\n",
       "•\tPeriodic news, leaflets and blog\n",
       "During the period, some promotional materials as well dissemination products have been designed and made available to the partners and public through the project web site: some Institutional Poster,  CHARISMA brochures (summarising the project activities and objectives to the general structure of the project) and   leaflets (specifically referred to the three transnational access services: ARCHLAB, MOLAB and FIXLAB).   \n",
       "Periodic news have been published on the website, in collaboration with all consortium partners, such as CHARISMA related events, other events, and job opportunities. \n",
       "A partners’ blog designed and managed by OCW-RCE researchers, gave a glimpse into the project, as well as the experiences carried out throughout its development. The blog allowed the RCE CHARISMA group to record events, opinions, and ideas freely, as individual posts, with no need to define their scope. \n",

       "• The ‘EMAC evaluation report’ was a contribution of the Extra-Mural Advisory Committee to the project interim evaluation. It has been specifically constructed as an input to the Mid-Term Steering Committee evaluation with the aim of examining the rationale for the intervention, the programme implementation, and the first two years’ products and achievements. \n",
       "• The EU Workshop on Research Infrastructures for Cultural Heritage and Global Change Brussels, 14 March 2012 at KIK-IRPA, was organised by the European Commission, Directorate General for Research and Innovation, in collaboration with CHARISMA;\n",
       "• A CHARISMA video was released, providing a general overview of the project&amp;#39;s support, coordination and joint research activities, showing potential users, stakeholders and public the facilities involved and the Transnational Access opportunities. The movie is available on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MhAwxoi1zw). \n",
       "• A stand managed by CNR-IFAC equipped with optical windows at the Science Festival (held in Genova, IT, on 27 Oct- 7 Nov. 2010), permitted to carry out demonstrations of the project laser cleaning research activities to the large public. A CHARISMA stand was also set up at the AR&amp;PA Innovation initiative of the 8th Biennial of Heritage Restoration and Management (Valladolid, ES, May 24-27, 2012) organised by the Spanish Castilla &amp; León Regional Authority, in liaison with the European Commission and Labein-Tecnalia Research Centre and with the support of UNESCO.\n",
       "• The Project Final Event workshop entitled ‘Experience, Research and Innovation: a Research Infrastructures Integrated Platform for Cultural Heritage Conservation/Restoration’ was dedicated to the assessment of the project implementation through the intervention of external speakers, including a poster session and an open demonstration of the performances of the innovative instrumentations and methodologies developed.\n",

       "3.3 The transnational access activity \n",
       "The Transnational Access programme had the general mission to offer a portfolio of services and activities centred on the needs of the heritage science community in Europe and Associated Countries. The activity promoted the development of advanced research in the study and conservation of works of art, offering users the exploitation of unique European resources for in situ and laboratory investigations on artwork materials.\n",
       "The support activities were planned to cover the needs of researchers in the different phases of research development, as: a) Information on previous studies and data (ARCHLAB); \n",
       "b) In-situ non-invasive measurements for the acquisition of all the possible experimental data, avoiding any contact (and therefore any possible damage) with the investigated object (MOLAB); \n",
       "c) Deepening of the study through micro-sampling exploiting all the most advanced state-of-the-art techniques presently available (FIXLAB).\n",
       "The specific activity of the Welcome Desks, composed by representatives of the access providers, gave focused technical information to users or user groups on the experimental work to be carried out, (feasibility aspects and other concerns), and, if required, even suggested the most appropriate exploitation of the facilities (a unique or a group of facilities).\n",
       "The CHARISMA TA plan represented a unique experimentation of a model of integration and cooperation among infrastructures open for transnational access, offering together an integrated service in favour of researchers in heritage science. Through the three programs of access the project delivered to the users (from experienced practitioners to primary users) not only experimental resources but also methodological approaches, compliant best practices, tools and technologies to allow researchers carry out their work in conditions otherwise impossible for them. The summary of the work developed for the whole duration by ARCHLAB, MOLAB and FIXLAB (users’ projects, access days and number of users) is in Table 3, attached (Final Report - Tables).\n",

       "[CNRS/MCC-C2RMF (WPL), NGL, BM, OPD, PRADO, OCW-RCE]\n",
       "ARCHLAB was a facility composed by the archives of laboratories of national museums, such as National Gallery of London, British Museum and Museo del Prado; or laboratories of conservation institutions such as the Centre de Recherche st de Restauration des Musées de France, FR, Opificio delle Pietre Dure, IT, and Agency for Research in Cultural Heritage, NL. \n",
       "These laboratories possess wide archives on analytical and technical data on paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, metals, and historic objects of various types, regions and periods etc., collected through years of “institutional” activities devoted to the study, conservation and safeguard of cultural heritage. \n",
       "The data consists of documentation on the examination of constituent materials, technology, state of conservation, stratigraphy, etc. for each investigated object, including images and other technical and scientific data. Collections of samples are also available, taken from artworks and monuments during previous campaigns of study and conservation, carefully archived after investigations.\n",
       " The total number of proposals received by ARCHLAB were 154 of which around 50% were selected by the Peer Review Panel. The users were belonging to several different countries as: Austria, Denmark, France, Germany,  Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Macedonia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, United Kingdom.\n",
       "The majority of projects (69%) were focused on artefacts execution techniques, 14% on history of conservation, 13% on specific conservation issues, and 4% on materials and chemical analysis. With respect to the types of artefacts, it was registered a predominance of projects focused on paintings.\n",
       "Typical users were: (a) researchers that wanted to collect information concerning structure of support, materials, colours, stratigraphy, or composition of grounds in polychromies; (b) art-historians or archaeologists that wanted to carry out provenance studies or studies on ancient execution techniques, or wanted to compare collections; (c) conservators and scientists that wanted to inform cleaning and restoration data with other data collected in previous interventions on objects analogous to those on which they were working, (d) and others. \n",
       "The ARCHLAB success is indicated by the scientific quality of the work developed by the users, the large number of access days offered (397 on 324 planned), the large number of users that exploited the open archives (131 on 102 planned) and by the large number of research projects that have been developed (85 on 72 planned). \n",
       "•\tMain results achieved (some examples)\n",
       "• A successful ARCHLAB access project regarded the execution technique of the famous painting Battle of San Romano by Paolo Uccello. The painting, originally composed by three panels, is today dismembered and panels are at the National Gallery of London, the Louvre Museum of Paris, and the Uffizi Gallery of Firenze. ARCHLAB permitted the access user group (UGL restorer in charge of the restoration of the Uffizi panel) to compare the results of the technical examinations in the Uffizi (prior and during restoration) with those obtained in Paris (C2RMF Archives) on the panel of the Louvre and in London at the National Gallery (NGL Archives). The upcoming publication of a book on the restoration of the Battle of San Romano, includes a section regarding the study undertaken on the London and Paris panels exploiting the ARCHLAB facilities.\n",
       "•  The CHANGE GROUND LAYERS project explored scientific data in OPD (UGL D. Hradil, CZ) comparing the measurements of ground layers of 16-18th century paintings in Czech collections to find reference localities of historical exploitation of clay‐based materials. The method of using the composition and technology of preparing grounds as an indicator of the provenance of the painting. For example: one of the last paintings by Caravaggio “Beheading of Saint John the Baptist” (1608) contains a red chalk with Globigerina fossils (so called “Globigerina limestone”) in the ground which is authentic local material from Malta island where the author spent last period of his life. This is in contrast with his other works, which contain the brown clay‐based ground - probably the most typical ground of North‐Italian authors of the end of 16th and the first half of 17th century. The same local Maltese material was also largely used by Mattia Preti who was acting in Malta in the last period of his life. See Fig. 3.3.1 attached (Final Report - Figures).\n",
       "• Another significant example of the work developed in ARCHLAB is related to the ongoing project of restoration and collection of new documentation on the van Eyck’s Ghent Altarpiece (Ghent, Belgium). The users requested visits to the archives of the National Gallery, Museo del Prado, and C2RMF. In London (NGL Archives), the users examined the scientific reports, conservation records, infrared reflectographies, photomicrographs and X-ray radiographs relating to the Van Eyck’s paintings in the National Gallery. In the archives of the Museo del Prado, the users had access to the conservation documentation, technical data, macrophotographs, infrared reflectography, X-ray radiographs and laboratory research reports on six important paintings by van Eyck or his contemporaries. Finally, at C2RMF, in Paris, the users examined the scientific reports, conservation records, photographs and X-radiographs carried out on the Van Eyck’s paintings located in French museums, achieving an excellent general overview of analytical results on the French panels, in a comparative approach. \n",

       "[UNIPG (WPL), CNRS- LAMS, CNR-INO]\n",
       "A large proportion of the historical patrimony consists of immovable objects that cannot be moved from their usual location, e.g. monuments, sculptures, buildings, etc. and therefore the only way to carry out non-destructive measurements on their materials is to perform in-situ measurements. Even in the case of movable patrimony, including precious paintings, ceramics, gems, manuscripts, etc., curators normally avoid moving artworks to a laboratory, because of the high risk for the integrity of the artwork posed by transportation and of the high costs of insurance. \n",
       "MOLAB (Mobile Laboratory) was a facility composed by a unique collection of advanced, integrated and portable equipment, moved to the site where the users were operating. The moving experts accompanying the equipment were scientists (in a number depending on the number of different techniques involved in the work) with competences on materials and methods in conservation and technicians. At each intervention, any measurement preceded by teaching modules, where a presentation of the characteristics of the instrumental devices was given, to ensure their safe and correct use by the users. \n",
       "Operators concurred: a) to assemble in-situ the various part of the instrumentation(s); b) to help in carrying out the measurements; c) to discuss the first interpretation of results with the users.\n",
       "During the whole project, 126 request of access have been submitted to MOLAB (through proposals mostly requiring access to more than one facility). Of these, 50 access to facilities were executed (46 planned), corresponding to 299 days of work (260 planned) for 239 users (150 planned), a number often enlarged to other personnel of the entire hosting institution (museum, open air monuments, libraries, etc.).  The countries where MOLAB operated were 11 (FR, AT, CZ, ES, CH, NL, SL, BE, GB, PL, IE).\n",
       "Typical users of MOLAB were conservation scientists or conservators/restorers (individuals or group members of public or private institutions) who were developing research to deepen the knowledge on the nature and state of conservation of relevant artefacts and/or to determine the optimal modality/condition for a programmed conservation’s intervention. Users were also scholars, conservators or scientists belonging to museums or other institutions operating in the field of artwork studies or heritage care, as well as restorers of public institutions or SMEs. \n",
       "The results strongly contributed to a better knowledge of the structure and materials used by the artists, giving also specific information (alterations of materials and their locations) useful for their conservation. \n",
       "•\tMain results achieved (some examples)\n",
       "• Access projects were carried out on works of art of great masters of the European history of art. For instance: Caravaggio (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin, IE), Van Gogh (Kroeller-Muller Musem of Otterlo,NK; Van Gogh Museum of Amsterdam, NL),  Picasso (Musée Picasso in Antibes, FR;  Museu Picasso of Barcelona, ES), Memling (National Museum of Gdansk, PL), Durer (National Gallery of Prague, CZ), Bosch (Academy of Fine Art, Vienna, AT), Van Eyck (St. Bavo Cathedral, Gent, BE) and others.  European, Mesoamerican and Islamic illuminated manuscripts have been also studied, as well as stones, mural paintings and glazed ceramics in monuments, such as the Real Alcazar in Sevilla or the Roman Theatre in Merida, ES. The Fig. 3.3.2 in attachment shows for example, the work of five MOLAB access projects (Final Report - Figures).\n",
       "• The results of MOLAB access project at the Musée Picasso of Antibes, FR, permitted to record significant indications on the use of Picasso enamel paints (oleoresinous house and boat paints), in combination with other types of ready-mixed, commercial paints and define the palette of the paintings of the Picasso’s Antibes period (1946), comparing these findings with receipts for painting materials available in the Museum archives. MOLAB also permitted to explore the connections amongst similar types of paints used on different works, helping to refine their chronology. \n",
       "Picasso manifested continuous interest in this type of oleoresinous medium for its qualities of expediency, durability, and vivid colors, aesthetic and, in the coastal town of Antibes, superior resistance to the weathering assaults of the marine environment. The Antibes cycle represents a prime site for the exploration of the Picasso’s pioneering use of enamel paints among which the paints of the French company Ripolin gained large popularity in Europe after the 2nd World War. \n",
       "•Another exemplary access project exploiting the instrumentations offered by the three MOLAB providers, on identification of painting  materials, regarded the study of pigments, binding media, and ground, commonly used by Van Gogh during the last months of his life, when he was in Saint-Rémy and Auvers-sur-Oise. Measurements were carried out at the Kroeller Muller Museum of Otterlo, NL. Special aim was to attempt the identification of pigments particularly prone to fading and degradations. \n",
       "Specific highlight was the identification of both pure lead chromates and co-precipitates of chromates and sulphates, with convergence of results by FT-IR and XRD. These compounds -that correspond to chrome yellow pigments of different composition, structure, and chromatic hue - are difficult to be distinguished by non-invasive techniques. The use by Van Gogh of chrome yellows composed by chromate/sulphate co-precipitates deserves particular attention from the point of view of conservation, due to the fact these pigments are particularly subject to darkening.\n",

       "[PA: CNRS NEW_AGLAE (WPL), SOLEIL, PB: ATOMKI-HAS, BNC-WIGNER]\n",
       "FIXLAB consisted of two access platforms, located in two European sites, offered by a joint group of four medium and large-scale installations, under a coherent management. The first one (Platform A) corresponding to the urban area of Paris, FR, was composed by  NEW_AGLAE at the Palais du Louvre, and the Synchrotron SOLEIL in Saclay, while the second (Platform B), was composed by the two Hungarian scientific centres of Budapest (Budapest Neutron Centre) and Debrecen (Ion Beam Accelerator ATOMKI).\n",
       "Through FIXLAB, EU conservation scientists, conservators, curators, art-historians, and archaeologists, applied for transnational access to advanced state-of-the-art laboratories and large installations in order to deepen their studies through appropriate and advanced scientific techniques. These studies were carried out directly on objects (when movable) or on selected micro-samples or on mock samples prepared in the laboratory, exploiting the most advanced techniques presently available in large and medium scale facilities. \n",
       "To the FIXLAB facilities, users from different countries brought their objects and samples to carry out measurements of different nature as PIXE, PIGE, RBS, PGAA, Neutron Diffraction, Small Angle Neutron Scattering, X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, and others. Most of the projects dealt with studies of pottery, glazed ceramics, paintings, enamels, bronze sculptures, stones, jewels, glasses, coins, armours, tiles, obsidians, gildings, gold alloys, ivory artifacts, silver table pieces, garnets, and many others objects and materials.\n",
       "The total number of projects executed by FIXLAB within CHARISMA were 138 (Platform A: 57 AGLAE + 18 SOLEIL; Platform B: 23 ATOMKI + 40 BNC-Wigner), a number higher than the 132 projects. Also satisfactory were the days of access: in total 703,5 (Platform A: AGLAE: 191 d; SOLEIL: 75 d; Platform B: 149,5 ATOMKI  + 288 BNC-Wigner),  higher than the 633 total days planned in Annex I. Finally, the total number of users who exploited the FIXLAB facility was 275, well above the minimum planned number of 192.  \n",
       "The service fully achieved all the planned objectives, as clearly demonstrated by the figures of the work developed and by the related numerous articles published in the international scientific literature. \n",
       "Considering the high number of submitted proposals and the quality of the work developed, it appears how the opportunities offered by FIXLAB have become, more and more known, diffused and exploited among the heritage science  community, leading to excellent results in characterising heritage materials, interpreting  degradations, understanding provenances, attempting attributions, establishing execution techniques, and, more in general, supporting the study and conservation of artifacts, in a framework of  multi-disciplinary approaches and solutions.\n",
       "•\tMain results achieved (some examples)\n",
       "• Typical case of a success application of Ion Beam Analytical facilities (New_AGLAE)  by PIXE and PIGE measurements, was the analysis of the Renaissance Venetian glass artifacts, (RVEG-LM2 access Project, UGL M. Verita, IT) regarding the detailed determination of glass composition for provenance assessment, but also understanding execution techniques and alteration of materials. The establishment of an extended compositional database as a significant tool useful for comparison with the analyses of object of dubious origin in view to confirm (or reject) their Venetian origin and even establish the age of the examined object, was an important pursued result.\n",
       "• Experiments carried out at the Synchrotron Soleil explored mostly the application of FTIR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques. Example of this type of study is the search of structural information about lead soaps (reaction products of lead-containing pigments and fatty acids from the oil medium) and their spatial distribution in paint layers at the micro-scale (PAinT access Project, UGL A. van Loon, NL). \n",
       "After selection of a coherent corpus of samples from traditional oil paintings, including a painting by Rembrandt van Rijn, Homer, 1663 (Mauritshuis) and an original painted ceiling dating from c.1650 (Johan de Witthuis, The Hague), the results of analyses were compared with data from 16 replica paint films constructed to simulate the lead soap aggregation processes. Samples from both cases showed comparable layer build-ups, composed of one or more medium-rich, overlying dark paint layers on top of a lead white-containing preparatory layer, that acts as the source of the lead to form lead soaps. The whole corpus of results provided important clues about the mechanisms regarding formation and migration of lead soaps in aged oil paintings.\n",
       "An exemplary work has been carried out (BNC_Wigner) on the earliest known iron artefacts, dated to circa 3200 BC, found in Gerzeh, northern Egypt (Petrie’s iron beds access Project, UGL Thilo Rehren, UK). \n",
       "The results through the neutron facility have shown that these beads were made from meteoritic iron, and shaped by careful hammering the metal into thin sheets before rolling them into tubes. They confirmed that already in the fourth millennium BC metalworkers had mastered the smithing of meteoritic iron, an iron nickel alloy much harder and more brittle than the more commonly worked copper. This is of wide significance in archaeology as it demonstrates that metalworkers had already nearly two millennia of experience to hot-work meteoritic iron when iron smelting was introduced.\n",
       "• The research on detailed composition and technological characteristics of the gilded threads used in historical Romanian textiles (IBATEX and IBATEX 2 access Projects, UGL I.Z.Balta, RO) demonstrated the importance of the integration of advanced analytical methods with historical information. Since the date of manufacturing of the specific textiles of the examined collection was known quite precisely, the results obtained on the nature and technology of the gilded threads, besides the information acquired, represent  an important set of reference data on historical textiles with metal threads that will be used for comparison in further studies. \n",

       "3.4 The research: techniques, instrumentation and technologies  \n",
       "A portal to cultural heritage knowledge has been created, to facilitates the access to the data stored in the six open archives of ARCHLAB. Two main research tasks were developed: the first was dedicated to the integration of the technical metadata associated with different types of data and databases, with the aim of developing an open gate to the Infrastructures’ archives on analytical and technical data. In the second, the processing, fusion and registration of 2D and 3D were analysed and tested and optimal methods of signal and imaging processing (WP8 Programme).\n",
       "New portable instrumentation and methodologies have been designed and set up, with the goal of exploring the artwork in-situ, at and beneath the surface, in order to determine non invasively depth profiles or tomography of paint layers, to localise alterations, measure patinas or stratifications, or evè4en determine penetration of organic consolidants into porous stones (WP9 Programme).\n",
       "Among the portable instrumentation, four different innovative pieces of equipment are now disposable for the community of scientists to carry out tomographic measurements. Based on techniques of IR-Scanning Confocal Microscopy, Optical Coherence Tomography, Terahertz spectroscopy, and NMR depth profiling, these devices are able to obtain images of objects, probing regions below the surface reaching depths that cover a wide range of distances, from hundreds of microns to several millimetres. The application of Terahertz imaging opens up the possibility of revealing in-situ (i.e. in a church or in a room of a public or private building) hidden mural paintings even under millimetres of mortar. Another high performance portable device offers high sensitivity monitoring of the effect of the environment on the surface of museum objects. Finally, a compact new system for the in-situ non-invasive study of organic and inorganic fluorescent materials capable of producing, in a single, unique equipment, absorption spectra, fluorescence emission and emission decay-time (picosecond scale).\n",
       "The application of laser cleaning methodologies to all material types, including cases where the use is considered “routine” has been also critically assessed. The innovations in cleaning procedures take advantage of the above-mentioned 3D diagnostic techniques. In particular, optical coherence tomography permits the monitoring of laser or traditional cleaning, in-situ, through immediate visualization of the in-depth effects of varnish removals.\n",
       "A better characterization of multi-layered structures in polychromies has been pursued also by micro-invasive approaches, through advances in the examination of cross sections that allow for a link of the identification of organic materials to their location and spatial distribution within the stratigraphy, an information that is essential for the understanding of execution techniques or material alterations (WP10 Programme). \n",
       "The creation of a new database of analyses and properties of colorant materials has been also pursued and innovative instrumentation for a spectroscopic in-depth approach to the study of painting layers by infrared imaging was also developed.\n",
       "The practice of frequent interchange of information and ideas among the three workpackages was particularly profitable in the work development, having all the planned research activities the common final objective of improvement of the services offered through the access programme, increase of the number of users, and the strengthening of the quality of the heritage science research.\n",

The objective was pursued providing virtual access of professional users to information on such data, through the integration of metadata coming from the archives, streamlined via a web portal in a regular, standardised, and consistent way. \n",
       "Main purpose of the Web Portal was to provide information to users on the rich content of the archives available through the ARCHLAB transnational access. The model was conceived to satisfy the following requirements: i) optimal management of the information and meta-information; ii) homogeneous representation of metadata to users of different profiles, guiding them in finding the information appropriate to their needs; iii) provide advanced search functionalities to the metadata related to objects identification, technical data and technical reports. In Fig. 3.4.1, attached, the RDOTE architecture is schematized (Final Report - Figures).\n",

       "In the first part of the project a prototype has been designed, assembled and validated by means of laboratory tests. However, this first experimentations revealed margins of improvement of the depth resolution. To this purpose, although not originally foreseen, the CLSM has been modified into a system able to work also as a time-domain confocal OCT. In attachment, the third version of the instrument, now capable to work also as a time-domain confocal OCT, Fig. 3.4.2 (Final Report - Figures). \n",

The lily form, made of gold is easily recognizable, while the line highlighted in blue indicates a very strong sub-surface reflection layer in the painting, clearly suggesting the presence of a hidden sub-surface metal layer. A cross section, examined via a microsampling carried out in the same area for validation of the experiment, confirmed the presence of another layer of golden leaf below the surface of the mortar. \n",

The maximum depth resolution of 2.3 µm may be achieved, depending on the sensor. In Fig. 3.4.5 attached, some of the models of NMR-MOUSE are reported (Final Report - Figures).\n",
       "In addition to the detection of 1H nuclei, a new sensor was developed suitable for the detection of 27Al and 23Na. The detection of 23Na is particularly relevant in heritage investigations due to the importance of sodium salts in the deterioration of stones. \n",
       "• The NMR-MOUSE system based on the measurement of relaxation time of  1H nuclei works quite well and can be successfully employed for the non invasive study of water or organic substance penetration into different stones up to a depth of 20-30 mm. The new sensor for 27Al/23Na is working appropriately for sodium containing salts. However, the decay of crystalline sodium chloride is shorter than the dead time of the sensor, leading to the limitation that the signal from 23Na in the solid state cannot be measured. To reduce the relaxation rate, 23Na atoms need to be mobilized by dissolution in water. \n",
       "• Experiments using the new sensor were performed on tuff stone of the type used for building the ancient walls in the archaeological area of Herculaneum in Italy. Non-invasive determination of the amount of mobile 23Na was carried out and Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) has been exploited to determine the distribution of 23Na relaxation times inside the stone.

       "• Removal of overpaintings from modern easel paintings has been also experimented and validated; LQS Nd:YAG(1064 nm, 120 ns) laser ablation has been successfully exploited for removing overpaintings disguising a portrait of a woman by anonymous, dated around 1930. See Fig. 3.4.7 attached (Final Report - Figures).\n",
       "After a vain attempt of removal the overpainting using traditional solvents, which resulted to be very aggressive because of the significant content of carboxylates (metal soaps), a laser ablation validation study was successfully carried out. Raman spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, optical microscopy, ESEM-EDX, and FTIR were used for characterizing the laser interaction effects on prepared samples and, subsequently, the uncovering tests directly on the artworks. The overpaintings on the portrait by anonymous were executed using chlorinated copper phthalocyanine green and Ba, Zn (Ca) based pigments in linseed oil. The presence of traces of Cr and Pb also suggested the presence of some chrome yellow. Traditional inorganic pigments such as lead white, red lead, and carbon black, and modern organic dyes (red synthetic azo pigment) in linseed oil were also identified before removal.  \n",

Surface Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) was also tested with success on micro extracts, in the effort to overcome the limitation of FTIR microscopy when organic colorants are present in mixture with other organic and/or inorganic compounds.\n",
       "• Immunological approaches for the characterization of proteins in paint cross-sections have been set up, to determine the distributions of proteins within the various layers of the paint when a proteinaceous binder or varnish is used. While enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods have been developed for the ready and specific identification of all the main proteins commonly used by painters, as egg, milk, and animal glue, a really powerful immunochemical probe has been successfully experimented and set up, composed by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalised with a dye for Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) detection. \n",
       "•  To determine the factors that affect the overall colour obtained in preparing organic pigments from anthraquinone and flavonoid plant sources and/or in dyeing textiles, important parameters influencing the final colour in dyeing textiles were established. The large quantity of data gathered, their ordering and their final discussion, have been the subject of a booklet, entitled &quot;Natural Colorants for Dyeing and Lake Pigments&quot;.\n",
       "• A semi-Preparative Liquid Chromatographic system was developed (Prep-LC) coupled to fraction collector for isolate individual components from madder and weld respectively, which were subsequently characterised by ESI-MS. Some of these compounds are not commercially available and not characterised previously.  The availability of these standards strongly enhances the possibility of a correct and precise identification of these colorants. \n",
       "• Extraction protocols were reviewed (http://research.ng-london.org.uk/scientific/colourant/) and a selection was then optimised for both dyed textiles and paint samples for a better identification of colorant present in textiles and pigments. In fact, mild extraction well preserves the colorant’s molecules and therefore improves diagnostics. The dyes investigated were indigo, annatto, safflower red, redwood, madder, weld, unmordanted tannins and tannins on iron mordant and for the pigments, were selected: indigo, redwood, buckthorn, madder, weld and cochineal. \n",
       "• To achieve a better understanding of structural and spectroscopic properties of metal-dye complexes, in both textile dyeing and pigment preparation, significant spectral differences were emerged for the fluorescence emission of alizarin and purpurin forming complexes with Al(III). Of particular interest was the finding that the experiments in solution and powder showed strong similarities, so they can be used as model for both cases. Theoretical quantum mechanical calculations have been also carried out. This activity opened the way for a more effective exploitation of computational tools in understanding nature and spectroscopic behaviour of the complex chemical systems that characterise heritage objects. \n",
       "• 30 synthetic dyes and 30 synthetic pigments (pure materials) were selected for the research on early synthetic colorants, based on their more common use in art objects and including all dye classes. For the experimentations, wool was dyed following historical recipes and mock paint samples created. Of the techniques used (including FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-VIS colorimetry) micro-Raman spectroscopy and HPLC-PDA were the most effective. Excellent HPLC-PDA results were also obtained for the dyes, while for pigment in some samples no response was obtained due to poor solubility. \n",
       "• Working from an existing system based on the cube corner technology of the IR-CUBE platform, an IR spectrophotometer system was developed using monochromatic illumination from 200 to 5000 nm, a Michelson interferometer and a Focal Plane Array detector (FPA- InSb camera) operating in the 1000-5000 nm range. The system allows images to be recorded of areas of a few cm2. The images obtained are in accordance with those acquired using another system, but the time needed for a single measurement is of few seconds, while the previous system acquisition times amounted of around half an hour.\n",
       "• A methodology for producing device-independent, standardised, comparable and reproducible images has been developed to allow the necessary correction/calibration transformations to be consistently applied, with the aim to facilitate the comparison and interpretation of the resulting images. Traditionally, the acquisition of multispectral images has been highly set-up dependent, making cross-comparison between different laboratories and researchers very difficult. A series of standardised experimental setups and acquisition protocols for both luminescence imaging methods and a range of related broadband reflectance imaging techniques have been developed and presented in the form of a user manual (see https://www.thebritishmuseum.org/pdf/charisma-multispectral-imaging-manual-2013.pdf). New versions of user-friendly software tools/workspaces were also created (see https://www.britishmuseum.org/files/charisma-bm-workspace.ws and https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/charisma/technical_imaging.aspx ).   \n",

       "4.  Potential impact and the main dissemination activities and exploitation of results\n",
       "\n",
       "4.1 General impact \n",
       "Cultural Heritage represents a fundamental bond in Europe, due to its uniqueness relative to other regions of the world. Actions for its conservation and preservation are crucial in shaping the European Research Area and undeniably require an assessment of the foreseeable evolution of its degradation. The social dimension of the Heritage Sciences field has not been fully explored, nor has its position in the European strategic technological area. Moreover, the conservation and preservation of our heritage imposes important socio-economic burdens on the European science &amp; technology system. National and regional funding remains largely uncoordinated leading to lacks of efficiency and lowering of the competitive position of the European heritage researchers.  \n",
       "High-level advanced CH research infrastructures, integrated, networked and accessible to research teams from across Europe, pillars of an ambitious ERA-vision, can play an essential role in this framework as fundamental tools for improving the quality of the scientific and technological research undertaken in the EU.   \n",
       "The contribution of research  infrastructures to European competitiveness is universally acknowledged, and the I3 instrument play a fundamental role in the involvement of users in the operation of research facilities provided that some conditions are verified, as: \n",
       "• The setting-up of a highly experienced trans-facility board to coordinate access and interactions with the participating infrastructures. \n",
       "• Provision of services by experts with a strong experience in the field. \n",
       "• The full guarantee that the usual selection process of proposals   are compatible with the specific needs of the user communities involved. \n",
       "The strong involvement of the large-scale facilities participating in the CHARISMA project, integrate all these new approaches within the organisations and obviates the need for the end-user and the requirements for the heritage sciences community. The new instruments developed for the CH field are certainly a good model for communities with similar constraints and instrumental needs, such as environmental sciences, on a longer-term basis.\n",
       "The CHARISMA consortium presents itself as a unique distributed and high-performance infrastructure facilitating complex analyses as required for academic and industrial research, while providing access to the latest technologies necessary to conduct advanced research for users, independently of the user location and of the resources. Its distribution amongst 11 European countries reflects its European scale, if not larger as the initiative takes into consideration European associate states along with extra-European countries. As an example, the success in jointly operating the two FIXLAB platforms, one in Western Europe and the other in Eastern, should be of great importance for European Heritage Sciences, especially regarding the dramatic door this approach may open towards the Eastern Europe cultures, including Russia, Central Asia and Middle-Eastern countries. In this way CHARISMA played an important role in extending the CH vision towards countries of exceptional culture in line with the pre-figuration of the future EU political challenges. \n",
       "\n",
       "4.2 Impact on heritage sciences \n",
       "The Consortium created a bridge between the Humanities and specialists in advanced material analysis, turning challenging experiences into creative encounters. The cross-disciplinary sharing of scientific approaches with knowledge of culture is of great benefit to both fields. The setting-up of European Distributed Facilities within CHARISMA, recognised by the users community as one unit, structured by a common dissemination policy and a strongly enhanced exchange of technical expertise, is a key requirement for a continuous strengthening of the awareness of the importance of the interdisciplinary encounters between the world of art history and archaeology and that of science. During its implementation, CHARISMA has pioneered the use of: \n",
       "• The coupling of “hard” and “soft” infrastructures through the implementation of an ambitious e-portal which prefigures a concept of “mixed-access”, truly adapted to ARCHLAB approach. This approach associates real and virtual access to the large quantity of data present in the archives of prestigious European institutions (museum and academic institutions devoted to research and safeguard of cultural heritage) completing the offer made by CHARISMA to users; \n",
       "• The platform concept, grouping “fixed” facilities with an in-depth practice of heritage research conducted by partners, and proposing a highly experienced service in order to take the best benefit from the joint use of such sophisticated investigation techniques, and optimise the usage of the European medium and large  scale facilities;  \n",
       "• The MOLAB “portable tools” with their success story, related to the novelty to bring a scientific laboratory inside the museums and conservation institutions, that has achieved a very high visibility in the international research and application communities working in Cultural Heritage. The EC recognized the need to stimulate the creation of an integrated European heritage research community and to promote the building up of extended expertise in cultural heritage, in order to maintain the European research in this important area at a global competitive level.  \n",
       "A relevant scientific and structuring impact of CHARISMA regards the activation of new user groups, as well as of associated partners, followers of the implementation of the CHARISMA activities. Enhanced support for access to a wide range of advanced analytical techniques offered by a unified set of distributed infrastructures opens new interests and extends new fields for research. In this context, the research activity was clearly geared towards the improvement of the quality of the services that can be offered through access. \n",
       "The access to equipments offered by CHARISMA includes both access to large-scale facilities and, as deemed necessary for the study of artwork materials, access to a unique set of portable high-performance instrumentations, many of which are prototypes, that allow measurements to be carried out otherwise impossible without sampling from the object or its transportation to a laboratory. Coupling of mobile instrumentation and large-scale facilities is then the best option for extending to the entire work of art the localised interpretation arising from micro-samples which, although giving in-depth characterisation of materials, unavoidably give information with a limited statistical relevance. The combination allows minimum invasive intervention on the work with maximum extraction of material information. \n",
       "The requirements for studying these heterogeneous materials involve the coupling of many distinct approaches (ion beam analysis techniques, synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy, neutron sources, lasers, chromatography techniques, etc.). This is in line with the current major development of micro-imaging techniques, using microprobe, near-field or full-field approaches. The integration of data coming from different sources was a major issue at the distinct participating facilities, which strongly benefit from approaches, where the need to couple elemental, chemical, structural and morphological data lies at the heart of many research activities such as, for example, the distribution of distinct organic substances in cross sections or the assessment of the nature, and state of conservation of a dye on the basis of its chemical composition.  \n",
       "On the other hand, through the various TNAs worked in CHARISMA and the development of joint research, the partners intended to make available to users efficient access to new frontier performance instrumentation, destined to increase the diagnostic capabilities of the distributed infrastructure in particular with reference to in-situ analyses. The monitoring of the structural modifications of works of art in response to environmental conditions is a key-step in programming preventive conservation measures (METROTECH). The in-situ non-invasive identification of organic colorants with fluorescence methodologies (triple measurements of absorption, emission, and decay time of fluorescence) represents a significant advance in technologies offered to researchers for diagnostic analyses. Outstanding advances are offered also by the development of portable equipment for CLS, OCT, NMR, THz. All these techniques are capable of creating 3D images corresponding to the layers beneath the surface of the object under study, reaching variable depth from micrometers to millimetres. These results are expected to open the way to unprecedented performances, such as the imaging of reflective painting materials beneath several millimetres of plaster or the detailed control of the execution of conservation treatments, such as laser cleaning, monitoring their effect on-line, at the same moment that they are carried out. \n",
       "\n",
       "4.3 Impact on society \n",
       "Learning the particular history of an artwork and how it was made, knowing how the potential degradation through exhibition to the public may threaten its durability, discovering how much society could lose in neglecting an artwork, are new exploratory ways for revitalising public interest in visiting museums. In particular long-term alteration issues are directly interconnected with environmental research activities, therefore promoting a novel way to disseminate these key scientific questions within European Society. \n",
       "In addition, this domain is of great interest at the economical level, first of all for the cultural market, which is mainly sustained by basic confidence in the durability of artworks. Secondly, many famous places in Europe attract visitors, a fact that implies long-lasting benefits for the European economy and international visibility.  \n",
       "CHARISMA could reinforce the confidence of cultural charities and foundations in investing in the preservation of artworks. Coupling research and conservation on well-known artworks with a scientific contribution may be of great interest for appropriate support programs and guarantee their input to the work carried out within the European project. Finally, the international attractiveness for young researchers and new users from overseas countries constitutes a leading aspect for our heritage sciences community. \n",
       "CHARISMA contributes to enhancing a political culture in Europe based on mutual respect and high-level competencies. Associating Heritage sciences experts from cultural institutions (conservation scientists, conservators, restorers) with specialists from Physics, Chemistry and Environmental sciences, in a fast moving scientific context, is a key aspect for CH Research. \n",
       "\n",
       "4.4 CHARISMA spread character  \n",
       "In addition to the support activities and the joint research plans, an important feature of CHARISMA will be its openness. A main ambition will be to provide an open setting, where an heritage science international forum, impacting on policy and practice, can be developed and updated. \n",
       "The activities generated by the project (e.g., professional technical events, training preparation, link with associated partners, conference and workshop organisation, presentations for a general audiences etc.) will not be mirrored by the project himself, but they will be enlarged. To establish lasting connections and cooperation among interested research institutions in Europe and beyond, enhancing the interest and visibility of the European heritage research out of the borders of Europe will open new ground for international cooperation. \n",
       "At project level, foresight information and communication concern collecting and presenting project activities, experiences, results to potentially interested users: they have been all aimed at increasing an effective knowledge-sharing with the public at large. In this process, detailed in the networking WPs, various tools were used, the website, and besides, publications, presentations in international events, press and news releases, documentation, expositions, conferences, videos, etc.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.5 Main dissemination activities \n",
       "In order to develop a helpful dissemination plan – a WP4 Steering Committee task - the CHARISMA Plan was drafted at the very beginning of a project, containing the activities to be continuously carried out until the project’s end (and possibly afterwards). \n",
       "The Plan indicated those activities to be devoted to ensure that the developed goal and results could be externally spread and exploited, both during the completion of the project and after its conclusion, through the dissemination of the final outcomes in the most suitable environments. The results and impact of the project efforts rest not only in the effectiveness of dissemination activities, but also in the possibility of their use. In fact, while the first is essential in order to attain the objective of making the project understandable and visible, the latter aims at assuring the conditions to take advantage of it.\n",
       "The Evaluation report of the Extra-Mural Advisory Committee, envisaged at the middle of the project duration and providing information and feedback, helped the discussion to adapt and focus the dissemination plan or devise alternative strategies.\n",
       "The three networking WPs were devoted to these issues. The structure of dissemination and communication effort, planned in WP4,  provided a wide range of activities sustained by WP2 and WP3, such as international cooperation, education, training, users’ awareness and technology transfer events to research laboratories, memory institutions and industrial organizations in the heritage field, based on the main objective of the action, the contents and the targeted recipients. \n",
       "•\tTechnical training events \n",
       "A series of trainings sessions have been carried out, primarily destined to advanced CHARISMA users. \n",
       "• Training on Mobile Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (28–29 April 2011, Aachen, DE) Dedicated to learn and practice the basic steps for art conservators that enabled the course participant to perform NMR analyses for investigating canvas paintings, violin bows, mummies, wall paintings etc. with the most advanced mobile NMR equipment. Technical insights on the practical use of the NMR-MOUSE (MObile Universal Surface Explorer) device and related data processing were provided. Training materials have been produced for use in the educational course. \n",
       "• Training on advanced laser-based techniques in art conservation, diagnostics and analysis (Heraklion, GR 18–22 June 2012). To provide an intensive, high-level training course to scientists and technicians on the fundamentals and applications of laser-based technologies used in art conservation, diagnostics and analysis. The following topics were identified: analytical laser spectroscopy (LIBS, LIF, Raman, THz); laser restoration: methodologies and real-case interventions; optical coherence metrology in structural diagnosis; and imaging and mapping: spectral and non-linear microscopy imaging.\n",
       "• Training on application of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to structural analysis. (27–28 June 2013, Torun, PL). The course was structured as lectures combined with hands-on sessions. Topics regarded traditional and innovative applications of OCT in archaeometry and conservation such as easel paintings, Chinese glaze, faience, historic wood, historic glass and reverse painting of glass. Hands-on training was carried out on easel paintings, jade and porcelain, and stained glass. \n",
       "• Training on spectroscopic techniques (invasive and non invasive) (27–29 June 2010, Ravenna, IT). Lectures combined with hands-on sessions on the role of spectroscopic techniques (XPS-SIMS, portable NMR, XRF-XRD, LIBS, μ-FTIR, μ-Raman, and others), concerning paintings, metal artefacts, mosaics, ceramics, and glasses. A methodology of use of a sequence of different analytical techniques was applied to a real case study (series of paper painted mosaic replicas).\n",
       "• Training on the technology of lakes preparation and dyeing textiles from botanical/animal source dyestuffs. (22-23 March 2011 Munich, DE; 30 November – 2 December, 2011, Brussels, BE). The first course “Back to the Roots - Preparation of Historical Lake Pigments” to better understanding of the nature, preparation, and use of historical lake pigments, relevant for paintings and polychromies. Participants learned to prepare lake pigments from selected red and yellow dyestuffs (madder, brazilwood, cochineal, lac dye, weld and Persian berries) according to historical recipes. Practical experiments were accompanied by theoretical presentations on the historical background of lake pigments, case studies, as well as chemistry and analytical identification of these pigments. In the second event “Dyeing with Natural Organic Colorants” the type and use of natural organic dyes for textile dyeing in preindustrial times, as well to provide a deep knowledge about the interpretation of historical recipes and practical dyeing technology was discussed.\n",
       "• Training on stone conservation (7-18 May 2012, Lisbon, PT; 10-21 September 2012, Torun, PL; 27 May - 7 June 2013, Amsterdam, NL). The training scheme of lecture’s main topics was stone artifact’s characterisation, their deterioration phenomena devising also suitable conservation methodologies, according to the modern conservation concepts based on diagnostics and innovative materials. Special insights were dedicated to the role of water and acid rains in the deterioration mechanisms of outdoor stone artifacts, as well as to the various aspects of biodeterioration. Restoration and maintenance strategies using the most advanced intervention techniques were extensively treated. Besides the presentations, visits to case studies were also organized.\n",
       "•\tOriented topic events \n",
       "The events were an opportunity to share and compare the results obtained by the European scientific community on focused priority areas, such as the advances in a specific analytical field (techniques applied on different materials and objects).

       "The video included short interviews with the Coordinator, the WP7 Leader, and some transnational access user’s group leaders. \n",
       "The project coordinator, explained how the technology helps artists: “New advanced technology allows us to dig really deep into the nature of art objects. We can understand its structure, the evolution of the creative process used by the artist. We can also get new information about when the work of art was created. And all this with an accuracy we couldn’t even begin to imagine before now.” Fixed research facilities are often too big to relocate. When they are, it is up to the art to go on the move.\n",
       "The WP7 Leader scientist at C2RMF, emphasised the importance of host institutions getting everything right: “Hosting European researchers means that they travel here with their works of art. Sometimes the transportation prices and cost of insurance are breath-taking. So we, as host institutions, can’t let anything go wrong. We can’t afford to start organising such a huge effort and not deliver because of a technical failure.” The objects are placed on an unique particle accelerator, devoted exclusively to the study of works of art. The French hosts need to make sure everything is ready for their European colleagues. \n",

       "\n",
       "6.1 Consortium agreement rules and confidentiality\n",
       "At the time where museums everywhere are grappling with what is culturally appropriate for data sharing, access to collections and reciprocal agreements, intellectual property (IP) appears as a guarantee of success for the scientific knowledge management. Despite the fact that IP claims surrounding CH issues can engender exclusionary practices, or unjustifiable restrictions or knowledge flows, concerns over sharing the benefits of research and unauthorised or commercial exploitation of knowledge, images, stories and designs will persist and fuel debates.\n",
       "The vast implication and repercussions of increased flows of ideas and information in our increasingly global and digital knowledge economy is of concern to the CHARISMA partners especially because IP issues arise between researchers and institutions or among stakeholders and information gatekeepers at the intersection of public domain, cultural knowledge and research.\n",
       "There is clearly much at stake regarding: i) open scientific knowledge vs ownership of knowledge; ii) restrictive vs inclusive modes of resolution; iii) rights of knowledge holders vs knowledge users; iv) legal definition vs customary definition of IP as well as the legal challenges of new technologies such as digital repositories.\n",
       "In this context CHARISMA partners are particularly concerned with the practical implications of flows, restrictions and appropriations of knowledge about the data handling, how these affect their access to researchers and other stakeholders, how they are defined and used and how fair and appropriate use and access can be achieved to benefit of all stakeholders.\n",
       "In addition to this awareness solicitation, the CHARISMA IP rules that have been prepared down within the Consortium Agreement, retained fundamental procedures associated to specific ones regarding confidentiality, ownership and exploitation of knowledge, as well as results and exploitation of results and copyrights.\n",
       "In developing and executing the WP8, WP9 and WP10 joint research activities, it is critical to understand the role of intellectual property and its possible impact on research and technology obtained, for a subsequent adaptation and/or further development. The principal quandary is to ensure that research innovations are issued in a timely manner and that promising directions for use are identified swiftly. \n",
       "In this context, the publication of scientific results originating from the joint actions of the consortium have been made as per the usual custom and practice of the CH scientific community, with the prior consent of all laboratories having contributed to results. All publications borne the statement: “The research leading to these results is partly funded by the EU Community&amp;#39;s FP7 Research Infrastructures programme under the CHARISMA Project (Grant Agreement 228330)”.\n",
       "WP9 and WP10 research plan was the most sensitive, considering the expected new technology instrumentations. In Plan of use and dissemination the possibility to transfer the technology (‘Products’, ‘Methods’ and ‘Experiences’) to ultimate users, i.e. to instrument’ producers, has been considered following the guidance IP rules set out in the Consortium Agreement. \n",
       "The users benefiting of access activities were also subject to IPs local rules of the partnership holder of the CHARISMA open facilities. In planning and conducting WP5 access activities - in which a massive pre-existing knowledge data owned and often not protected by the host Institution were  open to CH professional communities - several well-known IP key points were examined and taken into account, including, among others, the confidentiality of information, the proprietary nature of materials, the property issues associated with the collaborations processes (user/host institution), and/or the research tools. \n",

Executive summary The aim of CHARISMA was to build a new user-friendly platform of existing large-scale facilities or small/medium installations open to users and develop a set of the widest number of scientific methodologies and techniques, in order to enable the European heritage science community to gain improvement in the research for diagnostics, analysis and assessment of materials of cultural heritage, identification of artistic techniques, identification of the cause and effects of deterioration processes, and in situ monitoring during and after restoration. Long term objectives were: improve the infrastructure relationships and counteract the fragmentation in scattered scientific communities of the wide range of activities, integrate the research capacities across Europe and beyond, capitalising on the resources and expertise to foster and enlarge the user community, diffuse awareness at the scientific and decision making level of the vision and results of CHARISMA. Significant achieved results have been: • The deployment of functioning access nodes of the most advanced European facilities customized to meet the particular heritage requirements for research and applications on composition and structure of works of art, the technology used to produce them, the alteration of their materials in specific environmental conditions – including museums –, the establishment of possible remedies against deterioration, etc.; • The set up of high performance analytical equipment, for in-situ non-invasive measurements on artworks, without any movement of the artefacts from their location, permitting for a direct materials research on precious or immovable artworks, or monitoring innovative conservation methodologies during their application, even on the scaffolding at a restoration site; • The development of structured scientific information, available in the archives and documentation departments of both prestigious museums and conservation centres, consisting of an unprecedented amount of analytical data to unlock their immensely valuable data collections, making them more widely available; • The development of new instrumentation and methodologies for the study of artwork materials, at the surface (2D) and in depth (3D), both for laboratory analyses on microsamples and for in-situ non-contact investigations, overcoming technological barriers, improving the quality of the participating infrastructures and offering innovative technology solutions and competitive advantages for the production of new instruments for diagnostics; • The set-up of new advanced laser cleaning techniques, exploiting high security methods that guarantee the artwork, being based on local control of the intervention through non-invasive in-situ real time monitoring; • Establishing best practices for multi-technique analysis of samples, analytical data assessment or degradation issues; • Providing international cooperation, education, training, users’ awareness events, and technology transfer to research laboratories, memory institutions and industrial organizations; • Sharing knowledge on large scale EC conservation projects, adopting a progressive compatibility of individual archives and registers, establishing common approaches to the interpretation and easy exchange of 2D and 3D analytical data Project Context and Objectives: 2. Project context and objectives • Context Ancient and historical masterpieces are often exposed to the harmful effects of a changing environment or inappropriate restoration or handling, so that tangible cultural heritage can be intrinsically unstable. Many risks can be mitigated so long as proper knowledge of materials and degradation processes has been acquired. In fact, the detailed knowledge of the composition or structure of an artwork or an archaeological artefact is a prerequisite condition for any research in art history or archaeology as well as any action of conservation-restoration. This is crucial for decisions on proper preservation actions and undeniably requires an assessment of the foreseeable evolution of the degradation. To gain the deepest insight into the artwork properties, museums curators, conservators and heritage scientists should benefit from access to research tools of the highest level and to the most skilled teams able to take advantage of the outstanding possibilities of the corresponding micro-analytical tools. Due to their origin and ageing, heritage materials are generally mixtures of inorganic phases (crystalline or amorphous) and organic compounds (often at the micro- and nanoscale), which require powerful analytical tools to be identified. Mapping of constituents is now essential in view of the heterogeneous nature of heritage materials at all scales: it involves not only the distribution of elemental composition, but also of crystal structures, molecular signatures, etc. A large variety of advanced techniques – portable or microinvasive – is used nowadays, from laser to synchrotron and ion beams, from microfocussed spectroscopy to full-field imaging. Regarding conservation methodologies, laser technology has recently offered new solutions to the complex problems of cleaning dirt encrusted artefacts, this in spite of the complexity of the physicochemical risks associated with the ablation of photosensitive substrates and the limited opportunities for testing on real cases. Within this general frame, the lack of a coherent powerful platform of access to the widest number of scientific methodologies and techniques available in large scale facilities and small/medium installations, as well as the difficulty of sustaining coherent combined experimental strategies, have been in the past significant limiting factors to a rapid development of the European research. To close this gap, CHARISMA (Cultural Heritage Advanced Research Infrastructures: Synergy for a Multidisciplinary Approach to Conservation/ Restoration) has been established as an FP7 EU-funded advanced Research Infrastructures consortium, which integrates conservation/restoration scientific activities and transnational access, whose activities, developed within the period from October 2009 to March 2014, are reported in this document. • Objectives The aim of CHARISMA was to build a new, user-friendly platform based on a combination of the most relevant existing instruments, knowledge and stored data collections. The results must be capable of performing the necessary applications enabling the heritage science community answer complex questions related to i) diagnostics; ii) analysis and assessment of materials of artworks; iii) identification of artistic techniques; iv) identification of the cause and effects of deterioration processes; v) in-situ monitoring of conservation processes during and after treatments. • Main goals: • Provide the best opportunity for developing research at the forefront of the field, combining advanced scientific research infrastructures with the high-level knowledge of leading technology institutes on cultural heritage. • Couple cutting-edge research to intelligent delivery systems through interaction with end-users and experts in science applied to cultural heritage disciplines. • Optimize the use of infrastructures through a coordinated program of transnational access, joint research, and networking activities. • Overcome the lack of a coherent powerful platform of access to the widest number of scientific techniques available in large scale installations and small/medium facilities, sustaining combined experimental strategies. At the EU heritage science scale: • Develop a common accessible platform offering users the most advanced European facilities embedded in a complementary and multidisciplinary environment involving material science and artwork conservation/restoration. • Create a solid base for outstanding innovation in the capacity-building policies of science and technology, with expert knowledge on the most significant advances for safeguarding and protecting cultural heritage, enhancing the project openness across Europe and beyond. • Hold a program of open workshops and training to introduce curators, research-conservators and conservation scientists to the questions involved. • Promote a joint reflection work and share the best practice for multi-technique analysis of samples, analytical data assessment or degradation issues as well as knowledge on large scale conservation projects. Scientific and Technological Views: • Design and set-up innovative instrumentations, for in-situ 2D and 3D examinations of artworks, and new cleaning techniques based on laser technology. • Improve access to databases exploiting digitalization of data and their harmonization. • Carry out research on dyestuff identification to further elucidate the composition and behaviour of organic colorants. • Develop patterning and orientation techniques and new methodologies for the study of organic materials and their distribution in micro-samples or directly at the surface of the object. The challenges facing CHARISMA embrace transnational access, joint research and networking activities. 2.1 Networking The powerful advances in research over the last few years have coincided with a growth and spread of a culture of cooperation among European scientists, with an increase in the awareness of the crucial importance of sharing of knowledge, pooling of resources, and coordination of activities over the European area. Initiatives such as the Eu-ARTECH project, funded within the 6th FP, and others as European standardisation in cultural heritage, CEN TC/346, strongly hinted at this cultural development. CHARISMA strongly contributed to improve interoperability among the institutions of the consortium and those external to it, diffusing best practices and, at a more fundamental level, knowledge of new instrumentation, methods and technologies. During the projects years a progressive harmonization/compatibility was adopted of best protocols for multi-technique analysis of samples, following the type of object and material (stone, metal, paint, paper, polymers, etc.) or degradation issue (alterations, depositions) and in diagnosis and conservation methodology for monuments, historical buildings and sites. A uniform protocol for sharing analytical data of individual archives and registers (distributed data sets or database systems or different digital formats) was also completed. A detailed training plan has been developed to allow the cultural heritage community to benefit from the assembled scientific excellence through the organization of training events, seminars, &amp;#34;hands on&amp;#34; workshops to diffuse deep knowledge, expertise and well established methodologies to the users / professionals and to the public. To coordinate the compatibility of CHARISMA with related initiatives worldwide, to disseminate information about the project, its objectives and results, spreading internal and external communication trough the establishnent of target audiences, have been all other goals successful accomplished, creating two-way communication channels with stakeholders carrying national responsibilities, academic, research and conservators’ communities and users benefiting from project activities. Coordination fruitful activities included: - Share and compare the results obtained by European scientific community on focused priority areas, verify the impact of project work and grades through focused technical meetings and ensure the highest efficiency of the developed activities and verify that they correspond to the real users’ needs. - Implement the CHARISMA web site with a relevant dedicated Welcome access section, to apply for access, define and implement, in a coherent way, unified modality of access, the outreach of new users and the site review procedure. Brochures, project Logo, project Fliers etc. were also produced. -Monitor the success and impact of the project activities through the Extra-Mural Advisory Committee, having external feedbacks regarding the project objectives, its technical goals, milestones and deliverables -The delivery of the ‘Definition of quality control procedures’, so-called project reference book, a common procedural document, designed and developed to ensure a ready reference meant for the quality project assurance and the dissemination activities, including publications and presentations. For optimal use, the reference book was produced at the beginning of the project, and shared among partners. 2.2 TA Support The CHARISMA engagement offered to European researchers and professionals, a full access service - using an easy single entry point on-line - to the most advanced infrastructures and technologies for investigations on cultural heritage. For applying to techniques devoted to non-destructive examination of objects and samples (FIXLAB) the access was executed at two strongly integrated platforms, one in France (SOLEIL, CNRS) and the other in Hungary (ATOMKI-HAS, BNC), where Large Scale Facilities (LSF) were coupled to a set of medium scale instrumentations, completed when necessary with more conventional examination and analysis tools. The access to the mobile equipment of MOLAB, a unique set of portable instruments and associated competences, allowed researchers to carry out their work on-site, i.e. directly in a conservation laboratory, in a museum room or even on scaffolding in a restoration site. Basically, the equipment consisted of a new high-resolution VIS-NIR multispectral imaging device; a compact, portable XRD-XRF device, for in-situ XRD measurements on identification of crystalline solids; a miniaturised fibre-optic micro-Raman spectrometer, equipped with two lasers (532 and 785 nm) for the study of glasses and glazes, pigments and colorants; a prototypical spectro-fluorimeter for the in-situ measurements of fluorescence lifetimes in the scale of picoseconds, unique for its portability; as well as other additional compact portable advanced tools based on other chemical and physical techniques. These services were integrated with ARCHLAB, a “facility” enabling access to the huge quantity of archived knowledge and technical data held in the most prestigious European museums or conservation institutes recognised from France, UK, Italy Spain and Netherlands (namely: British Museum, UK; C2RMF/Palais du Louvre, FR; Museo del Prado, ES; Opificio delle Pietre Dure, IT; Agency for Research in Cultural Heritage, NL, and National Gallery of London, UK. These archives assemble analytical and technical data on paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, metals, etc., collected over many years of activities devoted to the analysis and studies for the scientific conservation and safeguard of cultural heritage. These archives have been through CHARISMA, for the first time, accessible to European scientists, engineers and technologists, together with art historian, archaeologists and conservator-restores, allowing the data held within them to be used in new ways. ARCHLAB, MOLAB and FIXLAB therefore covered the whole range of needs from the in situ studies on artworks, to the most advanced micro-analytical laboratory techniques for bulk, surface and stratigraphic investigations, to the access to stored knowledge and technical data. Their coupling allowed users to successfully combine a wide range of analytical facilities, for non-invasive and micro-invasive measurements, taking into account the particular issues of cultural heritage regarding security, insurance and transportation. The support to this novel investigation strategy was at the heart of CHARISMA transnational access activities (TNA). 2.3 Joint research The activity was addressed to extend the novel instrumental areas and to push their capabilities to the cutting edge of research, following the users’ requirements and the current needs of the research community, aiming at the development of: • Portable equipment for 3D in-situ examination of artworks, for integrated absorption-fluorescence- decay time measurements on fluorescing substances in the UV-Vis range and on novel cleaning methodologies; • Chemically oriented research for emerging innovative lab methodologies for the study of organic material distributions in cross sections or in the identification of dyes and their deterioration products/pathways, possibly as a function of their nature and provenance. The application of multispectral imaging and spectroscopy to the study of the distribution of organic and inorganic materials in art objects was also explored; • New methods to access and integrate existing heritage records and protocols should enable available data and knowledge to be made more readily available to cultural heritage professionals in a user-friendly, integrated and effective way, allowing direct exchange and comparison of data to be exploited. 2.4 Project’s team combined efforts (Beneficiaries List) • The Consortium The project beneficiaries, 22 of the most internationally well-known European institutions in the field of cultural heritage, cooperated to provide cultural institutions, SMEs, laboratories and researchers with new opportunities and technical developments with instruments, parameters and guidelines for carrying out their work, improving, at the same time their knowledge/proficiency/competencies.

The CA defined decision-making procedures, methods for reviewing the technical work, the settlement of internal disputes and the distribution of the EC grant. A meetings’ plan was agreed among partners to ensure that all partners took part to the program according to their role and responsibilities. A beneficiary in turn hosted the General or Interim meeting with a six-month cadence, taking care of the logistics and organisation. APRE supported the Coordinator in the definition of the agenda and in the collection of presentations by the partners. Minutes have been collected, distributed to partners and published in the Intranet website. • Communication with the European Commission. UNIPG, Coordinator, has been the intermediary for any communication between the EC and partners during the project period. • Administration of the financial contribution. The Community financial contribution was carefully managed regarding its allocation among partners, in accordance with the GA, the Consortium Agreement and the decisions taken by the consortium, informing the Commission. At the end of each period the Partners’ Financial Reports have been collected, giving homogeneity to all the information provided by the partners both in terms of content and editing; ensuring consistency between the expenses claimed by the partners and the activity performed. FAQ, general provisions governing the role and responsibilities of the partners, financial and contractual aspects were also implemented. • Quality assurance. The Steering Committee was in charge of evaluating technical progress, reviewing and assessing the project results, feedback of the results into redefinition of the project operational goals, and overall coherence. In this role, the SC was charged of project quality control and the status of each work package, ensuring the high quality of the data sets generated. The so-called project reference book ‘Definition of quality control procedures’ was implemented during the first year of the project, as a common procedural document, for the quality project assurance and the dissemination activities, including publications and presentations. • Communication and Reporting. During the project, the tasks of preparing, binding and sending the periodical Reports and the generated technical documentation have been exchanged in electronic format and made available to partners. To monitor the status of the planned project deliverables, internal reports have been prepared every four months. A mailing list service has been developed. To enhance and facilitate the reporting process to the EC, a Reporting Tool system, especially produced, was stored in Intranet and rendered available to partners. Appropriate exchange of information with beneficiaries has been ensured through specific meetings. Evaluating, binding and sending the periodical Reports and Annexes was also ensured. • Knowledge management. Matters related to confidentiality and intellectual property right issues handling have been defined in the Consortium Agreement and monitored by the Steering Committee along the project. • Main results achieved • The ‘Quality project handbook’, comprehensive of working tools describing the processes in place for the CHARISMA consortium, addressed in particular the issue of how to manage and monitor the project quality to develop and implement a process baseline, on which the Steering Committee monitored the project progress, stage by stage. • The ‘Report template and guidance’ was intended to help the project partners to prepare the project Periodic Reports, to be submitted to the Commission (M18,36,54), detailing the level of information required to WP Leaders/Beneficiaries for the description of the technical and scientific work carried out insofar. Furthermore, following the decision taken by the Steering Committee each beneficiary was required to submit to the Coordinator an Internal Intermediate Progress Reports. • The survey on monitoring the project’ Deliverables and Milestones status on a six months basis helped for the assessment of the work due in the period. This procedure was part of the Steering Committee responsibility together with the scientific quality check, the supervision and evaluation of the project technical progress and the revision of the project results. In this role, the SC has been in charge of the project global critical path, the scientific review of the work performed by the partners, including the degree of fulfilment of the objectives of the period, and the status of each work package outputs. Eight ‘Periodic status checks reports’ were provided during the project at M6, M11, M17 M24, M30, M36, M42 and M48, before the Steering Committee concerned meetings. • The EU Mid-Term Review, Heraklion, GR, 30th September 2011 provided an external evaluation and feedback. 3.2 The coordination activity Three different programs have been carried out in order to merge expertise and strengthen interoperability among the consortium institutions with the aim of establishing common best practices in studies of works of art and in analysis and assessment in conservation. Participation of all partners offered the possibility to take advantage of the different competences existing within the consortium on multidisciplinary investigation of materials, deterioration mechanisms, environmental monitoring, and conservation strategies. 3.2.2 Best practice and protocols towards common standards (WP2) [UNIPG, CNRS, FORTH, NGL (WPL), SOLEIL, CNR-ICVBC/IFAC, NCU, RWTH, ATOMKI-HAS, CPP-LMRH, BM, DI-BS, Of-ADC, OPD, PRADO, OCW-RCE, KIK-IRPA, LNEC, BNC-WIGNER, UNIBO, MCC-C2RMF] WP2 had the overall objective of exchanging knowledge and expertise within and outside the consortium in certain key areas of mutual interest among the partners, to establish common protocols, and to increase awareness of current best practice and latest developments, with the ultimate aim of raising general standards in the field of science applied to cultural heritage over Europe as a whole. The two tasks addressed targeted areas of current relevance and complementary to tasks in other CHARISMA joint research and access WPs. The first task concentrated on best practices, principles and protocols, the two chosen areas of focus being firstly the methodology for technical examination of paintings and painted objects (especially sample preparation and methodology for use of multiple complementary techniques); and secondly evaluation of methodology and scientific techniques for monitoring and diagnosis directed towards conservation of historical buildings and sites. Many different methods of technical examination are now used on works of art, depending on the questions being investigated and the type of object, but also on the facilities available in different laboratories. These are in a state of continuous development and improvement. Task 1a took advantage of the fact that CHARISMA included major laboratories in this field by carrying out a survey of practice in technical examination of paintings and painted objects across Europe. Task 1b also addressed best practice in technical examination, but instead applied to problem-solving and decision-making during large-scale conservation projects across Europe for monuments, historical buildings and sites. Working groups were formed for four main categories– stone, stained glass, metals, and wall paintings. The main achievement was the formulation of an assessment of the current state of the field, new developments and guidelines on best practice in the diagnosis and monitoring of the various materials found in historic building and sites. This took the form of a series of flowcharts indicating appropriate methodology for different materials, with additional commentary, presented in the deliverable D2.4 Estimation principles for planning and implementation of conservation projects in selected categories of monuments and historical buildings. As with Task 1a, a parallel practical exercise was organised. The workshop held at the former Cistercian Abbey of Chaalis, near Paris (24-25 Nov 2013), served as a direct means of exchanging information and opinions on the capabilities and relevance of various diagnostic techniques, in order to form a consensus on their place in the methodological flowcharts. Some of the new techniques being developed in WP9 were included in this workshop, so that potential applications of these new instruments could be explored. The second task in WP2 was focused on a different, but also very topical, area – exchange and integration of data generated during scientific examination. This is important to allow sharing as well as archiving, and is becoming increasingly relevant as initiatives develop for online databases that allow advances in searching and re-using the information, which in the future offer the prospect of more efficient use of the data as a research resource. Subtask 2b was more general in approach, addressing integration of the wide range of data and images and related historical metadata generated during technical study of any cultural heritage object. Importantly, it was demonstrated that although there is a common general strategy for the combination of different complementary techniques in the investigation of cultural heritage, there are neither common practices nor universal protocols for integration of the data, nor for organization of metadata. It is clear there is great potential for further development in this area, and a most significant outcome of this task was identification of actual needs and directions of common interest that could be used as a basis for formulating research priorities in this area in the future. • Main results achieved • The first main success of this task was a comprehensive review of current methods and new developments. Deliverable D2.1-1 was a substantial report on the results, made available on the project website. It included specifically: a) A detailed summary of practice among project partners for sampling methodology and practice for all types of painting (canvas, panel, wall etc.) and painted objects. b) A literature survey on general paint sample preparation, and needs for various FTIR techniques (synergistic with practical experiments in WP10) and promising new methods. • The work for the second deliverable D2.1-2 in Task 2.1a built on the first deliverable by concentrating on complementary strategies for analysis of samples with multiple techniques, and on sample preparation, a subject of current interest since many newer chemical imaging methods are demanding in this respect. In addition, sampling from precious cultural heritage objects must be limited, so it is particularly valuable to establish effective methodologies, and yet this is a subject not often dealt with in the scientific literature. In the deliverable, guidelines for appropriate methodologies and the results of detailed comparisons of different mounting and polishing methods for samples were presented. The combined results form a valuable resource for describing best practice and considering future priorities. • A highly successful complementary action was the event at SOLEIL synchrotron: Methodology in practice: hands-on workshop on sample preparation and methodology for FTIR analysis. This allowed practical knowledge exchange to be carried out on sample preparation for FTIR, ultimately also useful for SOLEIL FTIR beamline users via FIXLAB (WP7). Samples were prepared in different ways and the effect on FTIR in various modes tested: transmission, reflectance, transflectance or ATR – in the lab or on SMIS synchrotron beamline. • Analytical data are often generated in proprietary formats that do not allow easy interchange. The main achievement of Task 2a was a detailed review of current data standards aimed at constructing guidelines on suitable platform-independent file formats for a range of 2D and 3D data to allow sharing. The focus was on dyestuff analysis as a case study, since a practical need arose during WP10.2 for exchange of this data. The review outlined the need for software development to facilitate exchange of scientific cultural heritage data, and describes the functionality that would be required of such a tool • The evaluation and survey of existing software tools for data integration and documentation (inside and outside CHARISMA), described in deliverable D2.2-2, constitutes an important assessment of the general approach and specific practices or tools that are adopted for effective documentation and integration of analytical and imaging data acquired on cultural heritage materials and objects. In addition, a practical exercise on documentation and integration of the results of the WP9 round robin exercise using MediaWiki, proved useful in considering the needs and format of digital online tools for presenting analyses from multiple techniques. Both actions well served the aims of the task, which were to exchange information on specific digital documentation practices adopted by each CHARISMA partner, to raise awareness of good practice, and to bring together a review of the approaches and protocols in use in important European laboratories for integration, visualisation/presentation and interpretation of results from multiple analytical methods, as an example of best practice and to work towards adopting common protocols to allow more effective exchange of results. 3.2.3 Scientific excellence (WP3) [UNIPG, CNRS, FORTH, NGL, SOLEIL, CNR-IFAC (WPL)/ICVBC, NCU, RWTH, ATOMKI-HAS, CPP-LMRH, BM, DI-BS, Of-ADC, OPD, PRADO, OCW-RCE, KIK-IRPA, LNEC, BNC-WIGNER, UNIBO, MCC-C2RMF] Scientific excellence (WP3) was pursued through focused training actions and skills development in favour of CHARISMA end-user in focused priority areas, as well with sharing in scientific and technical meetings the results obtained with the European scientific community, verifying the impact of CHARISMA. The deep knowledge on materials and their behaviour, as well as on best approaches in evaluating their conditions and the selection of the best conservation procedures, has been diffused through the organisation of training events, seminars or workshops. Aim of such events was to train and engage researcher(s) in discussion with professionals (conservator-restorers, conservation-scientists and museum curators) on the appropriate application of the most advanced and novel analytical techniques and conservation methodologies. The WP highlighted also the use of expert technical meetings to disseminate a large fraction of CHARISMA’s principal findings. Three tasks, articulated into subtasks were foreseen. Task 1 “Sharing of resources and oriented-training on advanced instrumentation” [Resp.: NCU]. This task had the aim to offer researchers new opportunities to benefit from immediate and direct experience with new technological acquisitions and prototypes within the consortium, enhancing the possibilities for young scientists in establishing new research programmes. Trainings were also dedicated to professionals and new users external to the consortium on well established analytical/documentation techniques (NMR, laser-based techniques, OCT, etc.) or on the new investigation techniques and related technologies offered by prototypes. Each training event was under the responsibility of one CHARISMA partner, however, each event include other partners interested in the theme and able to cover topics and/or co-finance the course. Task 2 Sharing knowledge and oriented-training on advanced methodologies [Resp.: UNIB]). With the aim to support a better comprehension of the potentialities of innovative advanced methodologies among researchers of institutions external to the consortium, training activities and/or exchange of visits on problem solving approaches in conservation of paintings, books, buildings, dyestuffs, organic materials, etc. using advanced analytical techniques have been carried out. As for the previous task, behind the CHARISMA partner responsible of the organisation, each event included the active participation of other interested consortium members, that actively cooperated in lecturing, preparing notes, and in other tasks, also co-financing the course, if necessary. Task 3 Oriented-topics events [Resp.: NGL]. During the project, four technical meetings or thematic workshops on defined topics have been planned and/or organised. The objective was to verify the impact of CHARISMA work and grades. The workshops have been also an opportunity to share and compare the results obtained by European scientific community on focused priority areas in collaboration of the joint research programme. Main topics were: (i) Advances in a specific analytical field (technique applied on different materials and objects; sampling and sample preparation); (ii) Foresight studies for new instrumentation and technologies; (iii) A group of objects of one period / one style / one (painter) creator/ one (painting) technique. The events have been open to internal and external experts and to the professionals and users. Three of these events led to the publication of proceedings. • Main results achieved • Training courses, seminars, “hands on” workshops have been organised, to diffuse deep knowledge - expertise – and well established methodologies to the users / professionals and to the general public (see the following tables and the paragraph Dissemination activities in the Section Potential impact). • The highest efficiency of the developed activities was ensured, verifying that they correspond to the real users’ needs, in order to turn the assembled scientific excellence to the advantage of the cultural heritage community. • The results obtained by European scientific community on focused priority areas were shared and compared, verifying the impact of the CHARISMA work and grades through technical meetings and workshop. The concerned list of Training Courses on advanced instrumentation (Task1), on advanced methodologies (Task2), as well as of the Oriented-topics technical meetings and thematic workshops (Task3) organised and held, is in Table 2, attached ((Final Report - Tables). 3.2.4 Coordination of dissemination and communication efforts (WP4) [UNIPG, CNRS, NGL, NCU, Of-ADC, OCW-RCE, APRE (WPL), LNEC] For the achievement of the objectives of the project, communication and dissemination, constitute an important and substantial domain, being fundamental to share the information basis, to extend the participatory process of stakeholders, to attract users and project associates, and to gain fruitful feedbacks about the ongoing developments of the project. In the first year of the project a ‘Dissemination Plan’ handbook defined the Consortium strategy for communication and foreground dissemination, identifying the specific areas in which the project results can have influence, the different recipients and the related actions as well as the related initiatives/events to be performed throughout the duration of the project. In addition, an external evaluation and feedbacks accomplished through the Extra-Mural Advisory Committee, monitored the success, attainment and impact of the project objectives, technical goals, and milestones. • CHARISMA Associates Numerous expressions of interest were given to exchange expertise and to collaborate with CHARISMA from European countries external to the EU and overseas countries, including South America, United States, and Mexico. As part of the objectives for the project in order to extend the project scenario, and following several relevant requests coming from European or worldwide organisations, the Steering Committee approved the Associate Partners by means of a Letter of Intent available on the project web. Agreements have been established with Brazilian Associations and Institutes of Conservators-Restorers, as the Associação Brasileira de Conservadores e Restauradores de Bens Culturais (ABRACOR), and the Laboratorio de Ciencia da Conservação – Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (LACICOR). The association process was successful completed also for the University of Antwerp, BE, Pisa, Torino, Verona and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston, US, the Institute of Protection of Cultural Heritage of Slovenia, Lubljana, SL, the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico, Instituto de Fisica, Mexico City, MX, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, UK, and the Academy of Fine Arts of Prague, CZ. Associate Partners gave inputs (advice, best practices, statistical data, workshop organisation, etc.) contributing with their know-how to the project’s specific workpackage targets. They benefited directly from the project&amp;#39;s, workshops, web-based information, training schools, and so on. • A Database Target Users An Address Database (AD) was available to the project, starting from the list coming from the previous infrastructures’ EU-ARTECH project data. The AD implemented primarily involving the selected researchers/ professionals/ SMEs/ labs of the cultural heritage community with whom CHARISMA members previously collaborated and currently cooperate. A high number of data have been inserted (more than 1000 records). • Get Involved An open invitation to link to the project was implemented through the CHARISMA web site home page (Get Involved). It consisted of a user interest check page, that invited on-line registration (name, organisation, e-mail). Registered motivated people, were included in the AD mailing list for specific dissemination activities. The section, (closed at the end of the project) allowed individuals showing interest toward the project, to receive proper information about the open access calls and CHARISMA issues (events, job announcements, breakthrough results, etc.) permitting them to propose information of news or events of interest to specialists. • Friends EC projects &amp;amp; initiatives Following suggestions of the CHARISMA EC Scientific Officer, a number of Coordinators of other EC-supported projects or initiatives in the field of cultural heritage have been contacted. Special efforts have been made to achieve active collaboration with 3D-COFORM, POPART, STACHEM, NET-HERITAGE, DC-NET, DASISH, EuNamus, ECTP FACH and DARIAH (CHARISMA became affiliate project of DARIAH). In addition, a profitable collaboration with CEN TC/346 (developing European, EN standards for conservation) was established. • Scientific workshops and conferences Traditional channels of communication of the most advanced scientific achievements, such as presentations at scientific workshops and conferences, was also one of the pillars of the consortium dissemination activity. During the project, the dissemination activities have been the subject of Coordinator and WP Leaders’ invited conferences, with the objective to distribute general information on CHARISMA - at the service of the project as a whole - raising the project awareness, diffusing its goals, and enhancing the interest of potential users. In addition, the project beneficiaries participated in many meetings and international conferences related with CHARISMA topics. At these meetings, the primary results of the project activities were presented, underlining the FP7 support of the European Commission. Complementing this, papers were written and presentations at oriented seminars and conferences were carried out. (see the List of dissemination activities). • Periodic news, leaflets and blog During the period, some promotional materials as well dissemination products have been designed and made available to the partners and public through the project web site: some Institutional Poster, CHARISMA brochures (summarising the project activities and objectives to the general structure of the project) and leaflets (specifically referred to the three transnational access services: ARCHLAB, MOLAB and FIXLAB). Periodic news have been published on the website, in collaboration with all consortium partners, such as CHARISMA related events, other events, and job opportunities. A partners’ blog designed and managed by OCW-RCE researchers, gave a glimpse into the project, as well as the experiences carried out throughout its development. The blog allowed the RCE CHARISMA group to record events, opinions, and ideas freely, as individual posts, with no need to define their scope. • Main results achieved • The ‘Dissemination Plan’ formulated in a draft form agreed among partners at the project start, identified the CHARISMA policy of dissemination actions, as well as the related initiatives/events to be performed throughout the whole duration of the project. • The ‘EMAC evaluation report’ was a contribution of the Extra-Mural Advisory Committee to the project interim evaluation. It has been specifically constructed as an input to the Mid-Term Steering Committee evaluation with the aim of examining the rationale for the intervention, the programme implementation, and the first two years’ products and achievements. • The EU Workshop on Research Infrastructures for Cultural Heritage and Global Change Brussels, 14 March 2012 at KIK-IRPA, was organised by the European Commission, Directorate General for Research and Innovation, in collaboration with CHARISMA; • A CHARISMA video was released, providing a general overview of the project&amp;#39;s support, coordination and joint research activities, showing potential users, stakeholders and public the facilities involved and the Transnational Access opportunities. The movie is available on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MhAwxoi1zw). • A stand managed by CNR-IFAC equipped with optical windows at the Science Festival (held in Genova, IT, on 27 Oct- 7 Nov. 2010), permitted to carry out demonstrations of the project laser cleaning research activities to the large public. A CHARISMA stand was also set up at the AR&amp;amp;PA Innovation initiative of the 8th Biennial of Heritage Restoration and Management (Valladolid, ES, May 24-27, 2012) organised by the Spanish Castilla &amp;amp; León Regional Authority, in liaison with the European Commission and Labein-Tecnalia Research Centre and with the support of UNESCO. • The Project Final Event workshop entitled ‘Experience, Research and Innovation: a Research Infrastructures Integrated Platform for Cultural Heritage Conservation/Restoration’ was dedicated to the assessment of the project implementation through the intervention of external speakers, including a poster session and an open demonstration of the performances of the innovative instrumentations and methodologies developed. 3.3 The transnational access activity The Transnational Access programme had the general mission to offer a portfolio of services and activities centred on the needs of the heritage science community in Europe and Associated Countries. The activity promoted the development of advanced research in the study and conservation of works of art, offering users the exploitation of unique European resources for in situ and laboratory investigations on artwork materials. The support activities were planned to cover the needs of researchers in the different phases of research development, as: a) Information on previous studies and data (ARCHLAB); b) In-situ non-invasive measurements for the acquisition of all the possible experimental data, avoiding any contact (and therefore any possible damage) with the investigated object (MOLAB); c) Deepening of the study through micro-sampling exploiting all the most advanced state-of-the-art techniques presently available (FIXLAB). The specific activity of the Welcome Desks, composed by representatives of the access providers, gave focused technical information to users or user groups on the experimental work to be carried out, (feasibility aspects and other concerns), and, if required, even suggested the most appropriate exploitation of the facilities (a unique or a group of facilities). The CHARISMA TA plan represented a unique experimentation of a model of integration and cooperation among infrastructures open for transnational access, offering together an integrated service in favour of researchers in heritage science. Through the three programs of access the project delivered to the users (from experienced practitioners to primary users) not only experimental resources but also methodological approaches, compliant best practices, tools and technologies to allow researchers carry out their work in conditions otherwise impossible for them. The summary of the work developed for the whole duration by ARCHLAB, MOLAB and FIXLAB (users’ projects, access days and number of users) is in Table 3, attached (Final Report - Tables). 3.3.1 ARCHLAB - The archives of conservation institutions laboratories (WP5) [CNRS/MCC-C2RMF (WPL), NGL, BM, OPD, PRADO, OCW-RCE] ARCHLAB was a facility composed by the archives of laboratories of national museums, such as National Gallery of London, British Museum and Museo del Prado; or laboratories of conservation institutions such as the Centre de Recherche st de Restauration des Musées de France, FR, Opificio delle Pietre Dure, IT, and Agency for Research in Cultural Heritage, NL. These laboratories possess wide archives on analytical and technical data on paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, metals, and historic objects of various types, regions and periods etc., collected through years of “institutional” activities devoted to the study, conservation and safeguard of cultural heritage. The data consists of documentation on the examination of constituent materials, technology, state of conservation, stratigraphy, etc. for each investigated object, including images and other technical and scientific data. Collections of samples are also available, taken from artworks and monuments during previous campaigns of study and conservation, carefully archived after investigations. The total number of proposals received by ARCHLAB were 154 of which around 50% were selected by the Peer Review Panel. The users were belonging to several different countries as: Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Macedonia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, United Kingdom. The majority of projects (69%) were focused on artefacts execution techniques, 14% on history of conservation, 13% on specific conservation issues, and 4% on materials and chemical analysis. With respect to the types of artefacts, it was registered a predominance of projects focused on paintings. Typical users were: (a) researchers that wanted to collect information concerning structure of support, materials, colours, stratigraphy, or composition of grounds in polychromies; (b) art-historians or archaeologists that wanted to carry out provenance studies or studies on ancient execution techniques, or wanted to compare collections; (c) conservators and scientists that wanted to inform cleaning and restoration data with other data collected in previous interventions on objects analogous to those on which they were working, (d) and others. The ARCHLAB success is indicated by the scientific quality of the work developed by the users, the large number of access days offered (397 on 324 planned), the large number of users that exploited the open archives (131 on 102 planned) and by the large number of research projects that have been developed (85 on 72 planned). • Main results achieved (some examples) • A successful ARCHLAB access project regarded the execution technique of the famous painting Battle of San Romano by Paolo Uccello. The painting, originally composed by three panels, is today dismembered and panels are at the National Gallery of London, the Louvre Museum of Paris, and the Uffizi Gallery of Firenze. ARCHLAB permitted the access user group (UGL restorer in charge of the restoration of the Uffizi panel) to compare the results of the technical examinations in the Uffizi (prior and during restoration) with those obtained in Paris (C2RMF Archives) on the panel of the Louvre and in London at the National Gallery (NGL Archives). The upcoming publication of a book on the restoration of the Battle of San Romano, includes a section regarding the study undertaken on the London and Paris panels exploiting the ARCHLAB facilities. • The CHANGE GROUND LAYERS project explored scientific data in OPD (UGL D. Hradil, CZ) comparing the measurements of ground layers of 16-18th century paintings in Czech collections to find reference localities of historical exploitation of clay‐based materials. The method of using the composition and technology of preparing grounds as an indicator of the provenance of the painting. For example: one of the last paintings by Caravaggio “Beheading of Saint John the Baptist” (1608) contains a red chalk with Globigerina fossils (so called “Globigerina limestone”) in the ground which is authentic local material from Malta island where the author spent last period of his life. This is in contrast with his other works, which contain the brown clay‐based ground - probably the most typical ground of North‐Italian authors of the end of 16th and the first half of 17th century. The same local Maltese material was also largely used by Mattia Preti who was acting in Malta in the last period of his life. See Fig. 3.3.1 attached (Final Report - Figures). • Another significant example of the work developed in ARCHLAB is related to the ongoing project of restoration and collection of new documentation on the van Eyck’s Ghent Altarpiece (Ghent, Belgium). The users requested visits to the archives of the National Gallery, Museo del Prado, and C2RMF. In London (NGL Archives), the users examined the scientific reports, conservation records, infrared reflectographies, photomicrographs and X-ray radiographs relating to the Van Eyck’s paintings in the National Gallery. In the archives of the Museo del Prado, the users had access to the conservation documentation, technical data, macrophotographs, infrared reflectography, X-ray radiographs and laboratory research reports on six important paintings by van Eyck or his contemporaries. Finally, at C2RMF, in Paris, the users examined the scientific reports, conservation records, photographs and X-radiographs carried out on the Van Eyck’s paintings located in French museums, achieving an excellent general overview of analytical results on the French panels, in a comparative approach. The full set of projects and results obtained throughout the development of the ARCHLAB access programme, are listed and described in the deliverables D5.1, D5.3, and D5.5. 3.3.2 MOLAB - The mobile facilities for in situ non-invasive measurements (WP6) [UNIPG (WPL), CNRS- LAMS, CNR-INO] A large proportion of the historical patrimony consists of immovable objects that cannot be moved from their usual location, e.g. monuments, sculptures, buildings, etc. and therefore the only way to carry out non-destructive measurements on their materials is to perform in-situ measurements. Even in the case of movable patrimony, including precious paintings, ceramics, gems, manuscripts, etc., curators normally avoid moving artworks to a laboratory, because of the high risk for the integrity of the artwork posed by transportation and of the high costs of insurance. MOLAB (Mobile Laboratory) was a facility composed by a unique collection of advanced, integrated and portable equipment, moved to the site where the users were operating. The moving experts accompanying the equipment were scientists (in a number depending on the number of different techniques involved in the work) with competences on materials and methods in conservation and technicians. At each intervention, any measurement preceded by teaching modules, where a presentation of the characteristics of the instrumental devices was given, to ensure their safe and correct use by the users. Operators concurred: a) to assemble in-situ the various part of the instrumentation(s); b) to help in carrying out the measurements; c) to discuss the first interpretation of results with the users. During the whole project, 126 request of access have been submitted to MOLAB (through proposals mostly requiring access to more than one facility). Of these, 50 access to facilities were executed (46 planned), corresponding to 299 days of work (260 planned) for 239 users (150 planned), a number often enlarged to other personnel of the entire hosting institution (museum, open air monuments, libraries, etc.). The countries where MOLAB operated were 11 (FR, AT, CZ, ES, CH, NL, SL, BE, GB, PL, IE). Typical users of MOLAB were conservation scientists or conservators/restorers (individuals or group members of public or private institutions) who were developing research to deepen the knowledge on the nature and state of conservation of relevant artefacts and/or to determine the optimal modality/condition for a programmed conservation’s intervention. Users were also scholars, conservators or scientists belonging to museums or other institutions operating in the field of artwork studies or heritage care, as well as restorers of public institutions or SMEs. The results strongly contributed to a better knowledge of the structure and materials used by the artists, giving also specific information (alterations of materials and their locations) useful for their conservation. • Main results achieved (some examples) • Access projects were carried out on works of art of great masters of the European history of art. For instance: Caravaggio (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin, IE), Van Gogh (Kroeller-Muller Musem of Otterlo,NK; Van Gogh Museum of Amsterdam, NL), Picasso (Musée Picasso in Antibes, FR; Museu Picasso of Barcelona, ES), Memling (National Museum of Gdansk, PL), Durer (National Gallery of Prague, CZ), Bosch (Academy of Fine Art, Vienna, AT), Van Eyck (St. Bavo Cathedral, Gent, BE) and others. European, Mesoamerican and Islamic illuminated manuscripts have been also studied, as well as stones, mural paintings and glazed ceramics in monuments, such as the Real Alcazar in Sevilla or the Roman Theatre in Merida, ES. The Fig. 3.3.2 in attachment shows for example, the work of five MOLAB access projects (Final Report - Figures). • The results of MOLAB access project at the Musée Picasso of Antibes, FR, permitted to record significant indications on the use of Picasso enamel paints (oleoresinous house and boat paints), in combination with other types of ready-mixed, commercial paints and define the palette of the paintings of the Picasso’s Antibes period (1946), comparing these findings with receipts for painting materials available in the Museum archives. MOLAB also permitted to explore the connections amongst similar types of paints used on different works, helping to refine their chronology. Picasso manifested continuous interest in this type of oleoresinous medium for its qualities of expediency, durability, and vivid colors, aesthetic and, in the coastal town of Antibes, superior resistance to the weathering assaults of the marine environment. The Antibes cycle represents a prime site for the exploration of the Picasso’s pioneering use of enamel paints among which the paints of the French company Ripolin gained large popularity in Europe after the 2nd World War. •Another exemplary access project exploiting the instrumentations offered by the three MOLAB providers, on identification of painting materials, regarded the study of pigments, binding media, and ground, commonly used by Van Gogh during the last months of his life, when he was in Saint-Rémy and Auvers-sur-Oise. Measurements were carried out at the Kroeller Muller Museum of Otterlo, NL. Special aim was to attempt the identification of pigments particularly prone to fading and degradations. Specific highlight was the identification of both pure lead chromates and co-precipitates of chromates and sulphates, with convergence of results by FT-IR and XRD. These compounds -that correspond to chrome yellow pigments of different composition, structure, and chromatic hue - are difficult to be distinguished by non-invasive techniques. The use by Van Gogh of chrome yellows composed by chromate/sulphate co-precipitates deserves particular attention from the point of view of conservation, due to the fact these pigments are particularly subject to darkening. The full set of projects and results, obtained through the MOLAB access all along the three periods of the project, are described in deliverables D6.1, D6.3, and D6.5. 3.3.3 FIXLAB - Medium and Large Scale Facilities (WP7) [PA: CNRS NEW_AGLAE (WPL), SOLEIL, PB: ATOMKI-HAS, BNC-WIGNER] FIXLAB consisted of two access platforms, located in two European sites, offered by a joint group of four medium and large-scale installations, under a coherent management. The first one (Platform A) corresponding to the urban area of Paris, FR, was composed by NEW_AGLAE at the Palais du Louvre, and the Synchrotron SOLEIL in Saclay, while the second (Platform B), was composed by the two Hungarian scientific centres of Budapest (Budapest Neutron Centre) and Debrecen (Ion Beam Accelerator ATOMKI). Through FIXLAB, EU conservation scientists, conservators, curators, art-historians, and archaeologists, applied for transnational access to advanced state-of-the-art laboratories and large installations in order to deepen their studies through appropriate and advanced scientific techniques. These studies were carried out directly on objects (when movable) or on selected micro-samples or on mock samples prepared in the laboratory, exploiting the most advanced techniques presently available in large and medium scale facilities. To the FIXLAB facilities, users from different countries brought their objects and samples to carry out measurements of different nature as PIXE, PIGE, RBS, PGAA, Neutron Diffraction, Small Angle Neutron Scattering, X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, and others. Most of the projects dealt with studies of pottery, glazed ceramics, paintings, enamels, bronze sculptures, stones, jewels, glasses, coins, armours, tiles, obsidians, gildings, gold alloys, ivory artifacts, silver table pieces, garnets, and many others objects and materials. The total number of projects executed by FIXLAB within CHARISMA were 138 (Platform A: 57 AGLAE + 18 SOLEIL; Platform B: 23 ATOMKI + 40 BNC-Wigner), a number higher than the 132 projects. Also satisfactory were the days of access: in total 703,5 (Platform A: AGLAE: 191 d; SOLEIL: 75 d; Platform B: 149,5 ATOMKI + 288 BNC-Wigner), higher than the 633 total days planned in Annex I. Finally, the total number of users who exploited the FIXLAB facility was 275, well above the minimum planned number of 192. The service fully achieved all the planned objectives, as clearly demonstrated by the figures of the work developed and by the related numerous articles published in the international scientific literature. Considering the high number of submitted proposals and the quality of the work developed, it appears how the opportunities offered by FIXLAB have become, more and more known, diffused and exploited among the heritage science community, leading to excellent results in characterising heritage materials, interpreting degradations, understanding provenances, attempting attributions, establishing execution techniques, and, more in general, supporting the study and conservation of artifacts, in a framework of multi-disciplinary approaches and solutions. • Main results achieved (some examples) • Typical case of a success application of Ion Beam Analytical facilities (New_AGLAE) by PIXE and PIGE measurements, was the analysis of the Renaissance Venetian glass artifacts, (RVEG-LM2 access Project, UGL M. Verita, IT) regarding the detailed determination of glass composition for provenance assessment, but also understanding execution techniques and alteration of materials. The establishment of an extended compositional database as a significant tool useful for comparison with the analyses of object of dubious origin in view to confirm (or reject) their Venetian origin and even establish the age of the examined object, was an important pursued result. • Experiments carried out at the Synchrotron Soleil explored mostly the application of FTIR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques. Example of this type of study is the search of structural information about lead soaps (reaction products of lead-containing pigments and fatty acids from the oil medium) and their spatial distribution in paint layers at the micro-scale (PAinT access Project, UGL A. van Loon, NL). After selection of a coherent corpus of samples from traditional oil paintings, including a painting by Rembrandt van Rijn, Homer, 1663 (Mauritshuis) and an original painted ceiling dating from c.1650 (Johan de Witthuis, The Hague), the results of analyses were compared with data from 16 replica paint films constructed to simulate the lead soap aggregation processes. Samples from both cases showed comparable layer build-ups, composed of one or more medium-rich, overlying dark paint layers on top of a lead white-containing preparatory layer, that acts as the source of the lead to form lead soaps. The whole corpus of results provided important clues about the mechanisms regarding formation and migration of lead soaps in aged oil paintings. An exemplary work has been carried out (BNC_Wigner) on the earliest known iron artefacts, dated to circa 3200 BC, found in Gerzeh, northern Egypt (Petrie’s iron beds access Project, UGL Thilo Rehren, UK). The results through the neutron facility have shown that these beads were made from meteoritic iron, and shaped by careful hammering the metal into thin sheets before rolling them into tubes. They confirmed that already in the fourth millennium BC metalworkers had mastered the smithing of meteoritic iron, an iron nickel alloy much harder and more brittle than the more commonly worked copper. This is of wide significance in archaeology as it demonstrates that metalworkers had already nearly two millennia of experience to hot-work meteoritic iron when iron smelting was introduced. • The research on detailed composition and technological characteristics of the gilded threads used in historical Romanian textiles (IBATEX and IBATEX 2 access Projects, UGL I.Z.Balta, RO) demonstrated the importance of the integration of advanced analytical methods with historical information. Since the date of manufacturing of the specific textiles of the examined collection was known quite precisely, the results obtained on the nature and technology of the gilded threads, besides the information acquired, represent an important set of reference data on historical textiles with metal threads that will be used for comparison in further studies. In the attached Figs. 3.3.3 and 3.3.4, some images related to access projects carried out at the two platform: (A) CNRS NEW_AGLAE and SOLEIL, (B) ATOMKI-HAS and BNC-WIGNER (Final Report - Figures). 3.4 The research: techniques, instrumentation and technologies A portal to cultural heritage knowledge has been created, to facilitates the access to the data stored in the six open archives of ARCHLAB. Two main research tasks were developed: the first was dedicated to the integration of the technical metadata associated with different types of data and databases, with the aim of developing an open gate to the Infrastructures’ archives on analytical and technical data. In the second, the processing, fusion and registration of 2D and 3D were analysed and tested and optimal methods of signal and imaging processing (WP8 Programme). New portable instrumentation and methodologies have been designed and set up, with the goal of exploring the artwork in-situ, at and beneath the surface, in order to determine non invasively depth profiles or tomography of paint layers, to localise alterations, measure patinas or stratifications, or evè4en determine penetration of organic consolidants into porous stones (WP9 Programme). Among the portable instrumentation, four different innovative pieces of equipment are now disposable for the community of scientists to carry out tomographic measurements. Based on techniques of IR-Scanning Confocal Microscopy, Optical Coherence Tomography, Terahertz spectroscopy, and NMR depth profiling, these devices are able to obtain images of objects, probing regions below the surface reaching depths that cover a wide range of distances, from hundreds of microns to several millimetres. The application of Terahertz imaging opens up the possibility of revealing in-situ (i.e. in a church or in a room of a public or private building) hidden mural paintings even under millimetres of mortar. Another high performance portable device offers high sensitivity monitoring of the effect of the environment on the surface of museum objects. Finally, a compact new system for the in-situ non-invasive study of organic and inorganic fluorescent materials capable of producing, in a single, unique equipment, absorption spectra, fluorescence emission and emission decay-time (picosecond scale). The application of laser cleaning methodologies to all material types, including cases where the use is considered “routine” has been also critically assessed. The innovations in cleaning procedures take advantage of the above-mentioned 3D diagnostic techniques. In particular, optical coherence tomography permits the monitoring of laser or traditional cleaning, in-situ, through immediate visualization of the in-depth effects of varnish removals. A better characterization of multi-layered structures in polychromies has been pursued also by micro-invasive approaches, through advances in the examination of cross sections that allow for a link of the identification of organic materials to their location and spatial distribution within the stratigraphy, an information that is essential for the understanding of execution techniques or material alterations (WP10 Programme). The creation of a new database of analyses and properties of colorant materials has been also pursued and innovative instrumentation for a spectroscopic in-depth approach to the study of painting layers by infrared imaging was also developed. The practice of frequent interchange of information and ideas among the three workpackages was particularly profitable in the work development, having all the planned research activities the common final objective of improvement of the services offered through the access programme, increase of the number of users, and the strengthening of the quality of the heritage science research. 3.4.1 A portal to cultural heritage knowledge (WP8) [UNIPG, CNRS /MCC-C2RMF, NGL, BM, Of-ADC (WPL), OPD, PRADO, OCW-RCE] General objective was to strengthen, complement and integrate the physical access to ARCHLAB, the unique “facility” of CHARISMA open archives, containing a huge amount of scientific and technical data. The objective was pursued providing virtual access of professional users to information on such data, through the integration of metadata coming from the archives, streamlined via a web portal in a regular, standardised, and consistent way. Main purpose of the Web Portal was to provide information to users on the rich content of the archives available through the ARCHLAB transnational access. The model was conceived to satisfy the following requirements: i) optimal management of the information and meta-information; ii) homogeneous representation of metadata to users of different profiles, guiding them in finding the information appropriate to their needs; iii) provide advanced search functionalities to the metadata related to objects identification, technical data and technical reports. In Fig. 3.4.1, attached, the RDOTE architecture is schematized (Final Report - Figures). The activity encompassed: i) the Integration of technical metadata, consisting of the various steps leading to the opening of the portal toward the archive contents, and ii) the processing of the acquired information (ND techniques), regarding the optimal handling and fusion of 2D and 3D analytical data provided by non-destructive (ND) methods. Special reference was done to data provided by the methods developed in the other joint research work-packages of the project. • Main results achieved • From the home page, the users can browse artworks, artists, institutes, techniques, places, and periods or perform queries by combining selection criteria. The portal is accessible through the site http://archives-charisma-portal.eu/ • At the project end, a portal has been developed whose web interface introduces the user to existing metadata, on the data maintained and being actively advanced in the partners’ infrastructures, consisting of the content of the wide archives of analytical and technical knowledge acquired in previous studies on paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, metals, etc. • The information provided comprised: i) identification information, consisting of basic information regarding the object, such as title, creator, creation date etc.; ii) available technical reports on the examined object; iii) data information, which describes the data available about the examined object. • The web portal was open to users of the cultural heritage community from different disciplinary backgrounds; the achievement of this goal was supported by semantic web technologies and intelligent web services (semantic web, social network analysis, intelligent software agents) aiming at providing the user with data according to his (her) needs. • As second task final output, the handbook provided an overview (from a unified perspective) of NTD techniques, that can be used for analysis of art objects, presenting simulations and models, in the perspective to better tackle the problem of convergence and fusion of 2D and 3D analytical data. In the handbook, selected works that apply scientific and technological advances (in electrical and computer engineering, mathematics, informatics, etc.) for the analysis and documentation of artworks are put under focus and soft computing algorithms are described in a treatment rich of technical details. 3.4.2 New portable instrumentation and innovative methodologies for in-situ diagnostics and conservation (WP9) [UNIPG, CNRS /MCC-C2RMF, NGL, FORTH, CNR- ICVBC/INOA/IFAC, NCU (WPL), RWTH, OPD, LNEC] In-situ measurements have a high impact on the field of study and conservation of artworks. This impact goes beyond the simple technical aspects, because the introduction of portable analytical tools in the conservation practice has led to a progressive modification of the way of thinking about the best approach for the scientific examination of an art objects and even to a modification of the relationships between scientists and the other professionals in conservation (conservator/restorers and art-historians): - the movement of the laboratory to the artwork, instead of the contrary, avoids any risk (and costs) connected with the transportation of a high-value and fragile object into a lab, opening the way to the scientific examinations of a very large number of artworks, as was never done before; - the ability to get valuable information without touching the surface of the object makes it possible to analyze in a virtually infinite number of points all over the surface of the object, ultimately obtaining a more thorough description than in case of sampling; - the results are obtained practically in real time, creating a new form of relationship between scientists and conservators (or curators), based on immediate group-discussion of the results; this fact does not simply reduce the time of work, but significantly improve the quality of the examination; - the possible “non-confidence” on scientific examinations by professionals from other fields than science is vanished in front of the absolute non-invasivity of the measurements and the possibility to view and discuss immediate and evident results. In total six new portable tools and methodologies for in situ non invasive measurements have been designed and set-up in this workpackage. Innovative methodologies for laser cleaning have been also set up and validated. In the following, a brief description follows of each tool and methodology. The innovative equipments and the laser cleaning methodology have been the subject of a demonstration offered to the invited authorities, stakeholders, and public, in occasion of the Final Event of CHARISMA in Firenze, hosted by OPD. 3.4.2.1 Confocal Laser Scanner near-IR Microscope. A prototype of confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) has been set up for in situ non-invasive measurements on paintings. The goal was to make optical sectioning of paint layers without any sampling, with a very compact, low-cost and easy-to-use device based on confocal microscopy in the IR range. In the first part of the project a prototype has been designed, assembled and validated by means of laboratory tests. However, this first experimentations revealed margins of improvement of the depth resolution. To this purpose, although not originally foreseen, the CLSM has been modified into a system able to work also as a time-domain confocal OCT. In attachment, the third version of the instrument, now capable to work also as a time-domain confocal OCT, Fig. 3.4.2 (Final Report - Figures). • Main results achieved • Substantially, the finally developed prototype can work both as a confocal CLSM, as originally planned, and as an OCT device, integrating that developed in another task of this workpackage. The whole system is computer controlled: after the selection of the modality of operation and acquisition parameters (sampling step in the X, Y directions, acquisition rate, source amplification) the measurements are driven by means of a specifically developed software. • The device has been tested on several cases in collaboration with OPD, leading to positive results for the non contact 3D visualization and measurement of varnish thicknesses. • The system is very compact and easy to be transported, therefore is also fully responding to the needs of a portable and flexible tool suitable for the in situ monitoring of cleaning during restoration. 3.4.2.2 Terahertz Spectroscopy and Imaging Terahertz techniques are able to combine material characterization (spectroscopic mode) and time of flight imaging with penetration of optically opaque materials (non-polar, non metallic) suitable for subsurface imaging of several objects. The Terahertz system developed in this task is able to provide images from tens of micrometers to approximately one centimeter into the inspected object and therefore is suitable to provide mesoscopic details of an object, without the need of any sampling, either in situ or in the laboratory. After the assembling of the various components, the system has been experimented for different various applications and in particular for examination of paintings. • Main results achieved • The optical components are contained within a box of an easy to transport size and weight, and the fiber-coupled antennas permit rapid modification of the measurement geometry to be carried out. This is particularly advantageous because facilitates in situ examinations. • Among the various tests, particularly representative is the in situ test carried out on the mural Doom Painting at St Thomas’ Church, Salisbury, UK, where the system was experimented to reveal possible under-paintings under a thick layer of mortar. The examined medieval painting is representing Christ in Majesty, dominating a scene of judgement. During the examination, below the gilded geometrical figures of the halo of Jesus, a previous gilding was found. See Fig. 3.4.3 attached (Final Report - Figures). A photograph of the scanned halo of Christ is shown, together with the THz image superimposed on the photograph. The lily form, made of gold is easily recognizable, while the line highlighted in blue indicates a very strong sub-surface reflection layer in the painting, clearly suggesting the presence of a hidden sub-surface metal layer. A cross section, examined via a microsampling carried out in the same area for validation of the experiment, confirmed the presence of another layer of golden leaf below the surface of the mortar. • The performances of the developed THz system were positively tested also for the detection of wood-rings for dendrochronology and for in situ identification of pigments via spectroscopic measurements. • All the experimental tests, both in the laboratory and in the field, demonstrated the high potential of the developed real-time, high resolution, portable THz imaging system, a device complementary to the other tools for non-invasive in situ measurements, developed in other tasks of this workpackage. 3.4.2.3 Optical Coherence Tomography Major concept of the design of this new instrument was to dispose of an effective device capable to produce well resolved tomograms of varnishes and paint layers, that can be easily dismantled and easily transported for on-site examinations of works of art. In parallel with the designing, assembling and testing of the instrument, a data acquisition and processing software was developed, to ensure: i) high operation speed for high resolution real time imaging; ii) massive parallel processing of data with a Graphic Processor Unit (GPU) with use of CUDA technology. • Main results achieved • After the assembling of the system, several field and laboratory test have been carried out to improve the performances of the developed instrument. The list includes in-situ tests at the Museum of Fine Arts, Gent, Belgium, on the outstanding Adoration of the Mystic Lamb by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, in cooperation with KIK-IRPA in Bussels, and on La Muta by Raphael and on the Adoration of the Magi by Leonardo da Vinci in cooperation with OPD in Firenze. Several laboratory tests were also carried out on Azulejos (in co-operation with LNEC), various paintings of the 18th and 19th century, stain glass from National Museum in Wroclaw and other materials. • All test were very positive, as in the case of the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb where the experimentation was concentrated on thickness and number of vanish layers on ten different panels and two frames, leading to detailed information on varnish stratifications. In Fig. 3.4.4 attached, one of the sections of the varnish layers in one of the panels of the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb is reported (Final Report - Figures). Satisfactory OCT examinations were also carried out on stained glass. In this case OCT can be exploited mostly for revealing corrosion and presence of internal cracks and delaminations. In the case of the collection of medieval glass from Grodziec Palace (now in National Museum in Wrocław, PL) in addition to the surface gel layer, internal delaminations have been clearly detected. • A the end of the project, the planned objective of the research has been fully achieved and the newly set up system is working with very high performances. 3.4.2.4 Mobile Single-Sided NMR-MOUSE Depth Profiler The NMR-MOUSE (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance - Mobile Universal Surface Explorer) is a portable device that provides single-sided non invasive depth profiling of hydrogen-containing materials (organic and inorganic) in situ. Today the NMR-MOUSE® is a registered trademark and is available off the shelf. Starting from a prototype device, the system has gone through major improvements within CHARISMA and new models developed. • Main results achieved • The NMR-MOUSE® measures 1H nuclei and its different models may be employed for profiling at different depths. The maximum achievable depth in the last model is 20 mm. The maximum depth resolution of 2.3 µm may be achieved, depending on the sensor. In Fig. 3.4.5 attached, some of the models of NMR-MOUSE are reported (Final Report - Figures). In addition to the detection of 1H nuclei, a new sensor was developed suitable for the detection of 27Al and 23Na. The detection of 23Na is particularly relevant in heritage investigations due to the importance of sodium salts in the deterioration of stones. • The NMR-MOUSE system based on the measurement of relaxation time of 1H nuclei works quite well and can be successfully employed for the non invasive study of water or organic substance penetration into different stones up to a depth of 20-30 mm. The new sensor for 27Al/23Na is working appropriately for sodium containing salts. However, the decay of crystalline sodium chloride is shorter than the dead time of the sensor, leading to the limitation that the signal from 23Na in the solid state cannot be measured. To reduce the relaxation rate, 23Na atoms need to be mobilized by dissolution in water. • Experiments using the new sensor were performed on tuff stone of the type used for building the ancient walls in the archaeological area of Herculaneum in Italy. Non-invasive determination of the amount of mobile 23Na was carried out and Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) has been exploited to determine the distribution of 23Na relaxation times inside the stone. The experimentation demonstrated that the system is able to record multimodal relaxation components corresponding to sodium dissolved in pores of different dimensions. 3.4.2.5 METROTECH METROTECH is a system that is able to monitor the surface of the work of art offering the possibility of a continuous or periodic control of its morphology, establishing topographic maps of defects, indicating location of endangered areas with local estimates from high to low deterioration risks. In Fig. 3.4.6 attached, the in situ set up of the system is shown with the real time raw data of a defect map (Final Report - Figures). METROTECH measurements are based on the principles of digital holography and speckle pattern interferometry, which require strict boundary conditions to maximize stability of the system and minimize errors due to extraneous noise effects. • Main results achieved • The hardware and software development led to a final system, that is set for direct or remote operation, fully portable, pc driven, and equipped with user-friendly interface. Custom developed post-processing tools for expert analysis is also available. • The protocol for defect detection is fast and effective with topographic maps adding lots of valuable information to the conventional maps of the conservator. The improved automation and FT and FFT analyses are now able to provide excellent results on ceramic, masonry, stones, mortars, and wall paintings. • A considerable number of indoor sites were successfully examined either for environmental impact or defect detection, as Byzantine churches in Crete, the Dominikanon historical building, Valsamonero monasteries, St Peter Church, Eisodia Theotokou Church, Avignon monastery, and Chaalis. Museums may share similar indoor climate with climate controlled historical buildings. 3.4.2.6 An integrated System for Absorption/Fluorescence Spectroscopy This prototype is composed by a steady-state spectrometer, working both in absorption and emission mode, integrated with a single photon counting device for the measurement of the emission decay time. The system has been conceived to permit users to work either in the time-domain or in the frequency-domain and to collect spectra on the same point using different excitation wavelengths, by means of a set of several sources/detectors. The variability of the set up and the possibility to carry out different spectroscopic measurements on the same point is the main property of the system, relevant for the non-invasive in situ identification of luminescent materials used in works of art (mainly organic dyes and lakes and some inorganic pigments). • Main results achieved • Material identification obtained through comparison of the recorded data with ad hoc databases set up in the laboratory, enriched during the project development with the response of dyes and pigments provided by the project partnership. • Several spectra of absorption, emission and decay time of emission of dyes and colorants have been recorded and are available for comparative identification. A relevant family of luminescent inorganic pigments of different colours can be also profitably studied by the new system, as zinc oxide and sulfide, and cadmium sulpho-selenides. All these pigments are largely used in modern and contemporary art. • The prototype, in its last version, has been successfully experimented for in situ studies of ancient and modern paintings in restoration laboratories or in museums. In particular, it has been also positively experimented in the last MOLAB intervention at the Picasso Museum of Antibes, demonstrating to be ready for effective applications. 3.4.2.7 Innovative Laser Cleaning Methodologies: Biodeteriorations, encrusted granite and paintings To provide advances on the state-of-the-art of laser cleaning, an approach was followed based on: i) understanding which wavelength (including UV and mid-IR) and pulse-widths (including ultra-short pulses) optimize the laser-interaction for effective ablation, ii) operating in condition of absolute safety for the object employing on-line monitoring and diagnostics for material characterization. Following these principles, a set of advanced laser systems and application methodologies have been set-up along the project, allowing hand-held delivery of laser radiation with direct control of spot dimension and laser fluence suitable for safe applications on several types of cleaning problems. Optimal parameters and methodologies have been optimised in accurate experimental trials in the laboratory and then applied on-site, according to the specific needs. • Main results achieved • After the numerous experimentations: i) the safe removal of the lichen &amp;#34;Verrucaria nigrescens&amp;#34; and biofilms from Carrara marble sculptures has been demonstrated; ii) biodeterioration and foxing of paper artefacts has been validated; iii) laser ablation of iron-rich black films from exposed granite surfaces has been optimized; iv) laser induced phase changes and stabilisation of corroded iron surfaces were thoroughly characterized. • Removal of overpaintings from modern easel paintings has been also experimented and validated; LQS Nd:YAG(1064 nm, 120 ns) laser ablation has been successfully exploited for removing overpaintings disguising a portrait of a woman by anonymous, dated around 1930. See Fig. 3.4.7 attached (Final Report - Figures). After a vain attempt of removal the overpainting using traditional solvents, which resulted to be very aggressive because of the significant content of carboxylates (metal soaps), a laser ablation validation study was successfully carried out. Raman spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, optical microscopy, ESEM-EDX, and FTIR were used for characterizing the laser interaction effects on prepared samples and, subsequently, the uncovering tests directly on the artworks. The overpaintings on the portrait by anonymous were executed using chlorinated copper phthalocyanine green and Ba, Zn (Ca) based pigments in linseed oil. The presence of traces of Cr and Pb also suggested the presence of some chrome yellow. Traditional inorganic pigments such as lead white, red lead, and carbon black, and modern organic dyes (red synthetic azo pigment) in linseed oil were also identified before removal. • An integrated validation was also achieved on a further modern painting, which was found beneath overpaintings on the backside of the canvas of a signed painting by Giacomo Balla, one of the founding members of the Italian Futurist Painters. 3.4.3 Innovative methodologies and instrumentation for laboratory research (WP10) [UNIPG, NGL, CNR-ICVBC, BM, DI-BS, Of-ADC, OCW-RCE (WPL), KIK-IRPA, UNIBO] New methodologies and research strategies were developed for i) the characterisation and study of deterioration of a range of organic and inorganic materials, via non-invasive and/or micro-destructive approaches; ii) improving basic understanding of dyes and lakes by systematic optimal application of existing or new emerging analytical techniques. Specific tasks of this work-package were: Task 10.1 “Organic material identification in micro-stratigraphies” (Resp. UNIBO) devoted to the optimal application of the new chemical imaging methods, which can characterise organic materials and determine their distribution at high resolution within the stratigraphy of a paint. Task 10.2 “Organic colorants in ancient and contemporary art” (Resp. OCW-RCE), to overcome the problems that currently hamper accurate identification of dyestuffs, producing new methodologies and knowledge useful for the study and conservation of organic colorants in art with new analytical approaches. Task 10.3 “Multispectral imaging and spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance mode and fluorescence” (Resp. Of-ADC), for acquisition and processing of images for 2D and 3D distribution of organic and inorganic materials in artifacts. The task included image-processing techniques for the non-invasive identification of inorganic and organic substances and their spatial distribution. • Main results achieved • Suitable methodologies (sample preparation, instrument configuration, etc.) were defined for selective characterisation and localisation of organic components (binder, varnishes, colorants, etc) in paints or coatings characterised by a complex stratigraphy. • Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) was successfully experimented. for the identification and localization of organic materials (dyes and lakes) in cross-sections. Surface Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) was also tested with success on micro extracts, in the effort to overcome the limitation of FTIR microscopy when organic colorants are present in mixture with other organic and/or inorganic compounds. • Immunological approaches for the characterization of proteins in paint cross-sections have been set up, to determine the distributions of proteins within the various layers of the paint when a proteinaceous binder or varnish is used. While enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods have been developed for the ready and specific identification of all the main proteins commonly used by painters, as egg, milk, and animal glue, a really powerful immunochemical probe has been successfully experimented and set up, composed by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalised with a dye for Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) detection. • To determine the factors that affect the overall colour obtained in preparing organic pigments from anthraquinone and flavonoid plant sources and/or in dyeing textiles, important parameters influencing the final colour in dyeing textiles were established. The large quantity of data gathered, their ordering and their final discussion, have been the subject of a booklet, entitled &amp;#34;Natural Colorants for Dyeing and Lake Pigments&amp;#34;. • A semi-Preparative Liquid Chromatographic system was developed (Prep-LC) coupled to fraction collector for isolate individual components from madder and weld respectively, which were subsequently characterised by ESI-MS. Some of these compounds are not commercially available and not characterised previously. The availability of these standards strongly enhances the possibility of a correct and precise identification of these colorants. • Extraction protocols were reviewed (http://research.ng-london.org.uk/scientific/colourant/) and a selection was then optimised for both dyed textiles and paint samples for a better identification of colorant present in textiles and pigments. In fact, mild extraction well preserves the colorant’s molecules and therefore improves diagnostics. The dyes investigated were indigo, annatto, safflower red, redwood, madder, weld, unmordanted tannins and tannins on iron mordant and for the pigments, were selected: indigo, redwood, buckthorn, madder, weld and cochineal. • To achieve a better understanding of structural and spectroscopic properties of metal-dye complexes, in both textile dyeing and pigment preparation, significant spectral differences were emerged for the fluorescence emission of alizarin and purpurin forming complexes with Al(III). Of particular interest was the finding that the experiments in solution and powder showed strong similarities, so they can be used as model for both cases. Theoretical quantum mechanical calculations have been also carried out. This activity opened the way for a more effective exploitation of computational tools in understanding nature and spectroscopic behaviour of the complex chemical systems that characterise heritage objects. • 30 synthetic dyes and 30 synthetic pigments (pure materials) were selected for the research on early synthetic colorants, based on their more common use in art objects and including all dye classes. For the experimentations, wool was dyed following historical recipes and mock paint samples created. Of the techniques used (including FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-VIS colorimetry) micro-Raman spectroscopy and HPLC-PDA were the most effective. Excellent HPLC-PDA results were also obtained for the dyes, while for pigment in some samples no response was obtained due to poor solubility. • Working from an existing system based on the cube corner technology of the IR-CUBE platform, an IR spectrophotometer system was developed using monochromatic illumination from 200 to 5000 nm, a Michelson interferometer and a Focal Plane Array detector (FPA- InSb camera) operating in the 1000-5000 nm range. The system allows images to be recorded of areas of a few cm2. The images obtained are in accordance with those acquired using another system, but the time needed for a single measurement is of few seconds, while the previous system acquisition times amounted of around half an hour. • A methodology for producing device-independent, standardised, comparable and reproducible images has been developed to allow the necessary correction/calibration transformations to be consistently applied, with the aim to facilitate the comparison and interpretation of the resulting images. Traditionally, the acquisition of multispectral images has been highly set-up dependent, making cross-comparison between different laboratories and researchers very difficult. A series of standardised experimental setups and acquisition protocols for both luminescence imaging methods and a range of related broadband reflectance imaging techniques have been developed and presented in the form of a user manual (see https://www.thebritishmuseum.org/pdf/charisma-multispectral-imaging-manual-2013.pdf). New versions of user-friendly software tools/workspaces were also created (see https://www.britishmuseum.org/files/charisma-bm-workspace.ws and https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/charisma/technical_imaging.aspx ). Fig. 3.4.8 attached (Final Report - Figures). Potential Impact: 4. Potential impact and the main dissemination activities and exploitation of results 4.1 General impact Cultural Heritage represents a fundamental bond in Europe, due to its uniqueness relative to other regions of the world. Actions for its conservation and preservation are crucial in shaping the European Research Area and undeniably require an assessment of the foreseeable evolution of its degradation. The social dimension of the Heritage Sciences field has not been fully explored, nor has its position in the European strategic technological area. Moreover, the conservation and preservation of our heritage imposes important socio-economic burdens on the European science &amp;amp; technology system. National and regional funding remains largely uncoordinated leading to lacks of efficiency and lowering of the competitive position of the European heritage researchers. High-level advanced CH research infrastructures, integrated, networked and accessible to research teams from across Europe, pillars of an ambitious ERA-vision, can play an essential role in this framework as fundamental tools for improving the quality of the scientific and technological research undertaken in the EU. The contribution of research infrastructures to European competitiveness is universally acknowledged, and the I3 instrument play a fundamental role in the involvement of users in the operation of research facilities provided that some conditions are verified, as: • The setting-up of a highly experienced trans-facility board to coordinate access and interactions with the participating infrastructures. • Provision of services by experts with a strong experience in the field. • The full guarantee that the usual selection process of proposals are compatible with the specific needs of the user communities involved. The strong involvement of the large-scale facilities participating in the CHARISMA project, integrate all these new approaches within the organisations and obviates the need for the end-user and the requirements for the heritage sciences community. The new instruments developed for the CH field are certainly a good model for communities with similar constraints and instrumental needs, such as environmental sciences, on a longer-term basis. The CHARISMA consortium presents itself as a unique distributed and high-performance infrastructure facilitating complex analyses as required for academic and industrial research, while providing access to the latest technologies necessary to conduct advanced research for users, independently of the user location and of the resources. Its distribution amongst 11 European countries reflects its European scale, if not larger as the initiative takes into consideration European associate states along with extra-European countries. As an example, the success in jointly operating the two FIXLAB platforms, one in Western Europe and the other in Eastern, should be of great importance for European Heritage Sciences, especially regarding the dramatic door this approach may open towards the Eastern Europe cultures, including Russia, Central Asia and Middle-Eastern countries. In this way CHARISMA played an important role in extending the CH vision towards countries of exceptional culture in line with the pre-figuration of the future EU political challenges. 4.2 Impact on heritage sciences The Consortium created a bridge between the Humanities and specialists in advanced material analysis, turning challenging experiences into creative encounters. The cross-disciplinary sharing of scientific approaches with knowledge of culture is of great benefit to both fields. The setting-up of European Distributed Facilities within CHARISMA, recognised by the users community as one unit, structured by a common dissemination policy and a strongly enhanced exchange of technical expertise, is a key requirement for a continuous strengthening of the awareness of the importance of the interdisciplinary encounters between the world of art history and archaeology and that of science. During its implementation, CHARISMA has pioneered the use of: • The coupling of “hard” and “soft” infrastructures through the implementation of an ambitious e-portal which prefigures a concept of “mixed-access”, truly adapted to ARCHLAB approach. This approach associates real and virtual access to the large quantity of data present in the archives of prestigious European institutions (museum and academic institutions devoted to research and safeguard of cultural heritage) completing the offer made by CHARISMA to users; • The platform concept, grouping “fixed” facilities with an in-depth practice of heritage research conducted by partners, and proposing a highly experienced service in order to take the best benefit from the joint use of such sophisticated investigation techniques, and optimise the usage of the European medium and large scale facilities; • The MOLAB “portable tools” with their success story, related to the novelty to bring a scientific laboratory inside the museums and conservation institutions, that has achieved a very high visibility in the international research and application communities working in Cultural Heritage. The EC recognized the need to stimulate the creation of an integrated European heritage research community and to promote the building up of extended expertise in cultural heritage, in order to maintain the European research in this important area at a global competitive level. A relevant scientific and structuring impact of CHARISMA regards the activation of new user groups, as well as of associated partners, followers of the implementation of the CHARISMA activities. Enhanced support for access to a wide range of advanced analytical techniques offered by a unified set of distributed infrastructures opens new interests and extends new fields for research. In this context, the research activity was clearly geared towards the improvement of the quality of the services that can be offered through access. The access to equipments offered by CHARISMA includes both access to large-scale facilities and, as deemed necessary for the study of artwork materials, access to a unique set of portable high-performance instrumentations, many of which are prototypes, that allow measurements to be carried out otherwise impossible without sampling from the object or its transportation to a laboratory. Coupling of mobile instrumentation and large-scale facilities is then the best option for extending to the entire work of art the localised interpretation arising from micro-samples which, although giving in-depth characterisation of materials, unavoidably give information with a limited statistical relevance. The combination allows minimum invasive intervention on the work with maximum extraction of material information. The requirements for studying these heterogeneous materials involve the coupling of many distinct approaches (ion beam analysis techniques, synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy, neutron sources, lasers, chromatography techniques, etc.). This is in line with the current major development of micro-imaging techniques, using microprobe, near-field or full-field approaches. The integration of data coming from different sources was a major issue at the distinct participating facilities, which strongly benefit from approaches, where the need to couple elemental, chemical, structural and morphological data lies at the heart of many research activities such as, for example, the distribution of distinct organic substances in cross sections or the assessment of the nature, and state of conservation of a dye on the basis of its chemical composition. On the other hand, through the various TNAs worked in CHARISMA and the development of joint research, the partners intended to make available to users efficient access to new frontier performance instrumentation, destined to increase the diagnostic capabilities of the distributed infrastructure in particular with reference to in-situ analyses. The monitoring of the structural modifications of works of art in response to environmental conditions is a key-step in programming preventive conservation measures (METROTECH). The in-situ non-invasive identification of organic colorants with fluorescence methodologies (triple measurements of absorption, emission, and decay time of fluorescence) represents a significant advance in technologies offered to researchers for diagnostic analyses. Outstanding advances are offered also by the development of portable equipment for CLS, OCT, NMR, THz. All these techniques are capable of creating 3D images corresponding to the layers beneath the surface of the object under study, reaching variable depth from micrometers to millimetres. These results are expected to open the way to unprecedented performances, such as the imaging of reflective painting materials beneath several millimetres of plaster or the detailed control of the execution of conservation treatments, such as laser cleaning, monitoring their effect on-line, at the same moment that they are carried out. 4.3 Impact on society Learning the particular history of an artwork and how it was made, knowing how the potential degradation through exhibition to the public may threaten its durability, discovering how much society could lose in neglecting an artwork, are new exploratory ways for revitalising public interest in visiting museums. In particular long-term alteration issues are directly interconnected with environmental research activities, therefore promoting a novel way to disseminate these key scientific questions within European Society. In addition, this domain is of great interest at the economical level, first of all for the cultural market, which is mainly sustained by basic confidence in the durability of artworks. Secondly, many famous places in Europe attract visitors, a fact that implies long-lasting benefits for the European economy and international visibility. CHARISMA could reinforce the confidence of cultural charities and foundations in investing in the preservation of artworks. Coupling research and conservation on well-known artworks with a scientific contribution may be of great interest for appropriate support programs and guarantee their input to the work carried out within the European project. Finally, the international attractiveness for young researchers and new users from overseas countries constitutes a leading aspect for our heritage sciences community. CHARISMA contributes to enhancing a political culture in Europe based on mutual respect and high-level competencies. Associating Heritage sciences experts from cultural institutions (conservation scientists, conservators, restorers) with specialists from Physics, Chemistry and Environmental sciences, in a fast moving scientific context, is a key aspect for CH Research. 4.4 CHARISMA spread character In addition to the support activities and the joint research plans, an important feature of CHARISMA will be its openness. A main ambition will be to provide an open setting, where an heritage science international forum, impacting on policy and practice, can be developed and updated. The activities generated by the project (e.g., professional technical events, training preparation, link with associated partners, conference and workshop organisation, presentations for a general audiences etc.) will not be mirrored by the project himself, but they will be enlarged. To establish lasting connections and cooperation among interested research institutions in Europe and beyond, enhancing the interest and visibility of the European heritage research out of the borders of Europe will open new ground for international cooperation. At project level, foresight information and communication concern collecting and presenting project activities, experiences, results to potentially interested users: they have been all aimed at increasing an effective knowledge-sharing with the public at large. In this process, detailed in the networking WPs, various tools were used, the website, and besides, publications, presentations in international events, press and news releases, documentation, expositions, conferences, videos, etc. 4.5 Main dissemination activities In order to develop a helpful dissemination plan – a WP4 Steering Committee task - the CHARISMA Plan was drafted at the very beginning of a project, containing the activities to be continuously carried out until the project’s end (and possibly afterwards). The Plan indicated those activities to be devoted to ensure that the developed goal and results could be externally spread and exploited, both during the completion of the project and after its conclusion, through the dissemination of the final outcomes in the most suitable environments. The results and impact of the project efforts rest not only in the effectiveness of dissemination activities, but also in the possibility of their use. In fact, while the first is essential in order to attain the objective of making the project understandable and visible, the latter aims at assuring the conditions to take advantage of it. The Evaluation report of the Extra-Mural Advisory Committee, envisaged at the middle of the project duration and providing information and feedback, helped the discussion to adapt and focus the dissemination plan or devise alternative strategies. The three networking WPs were devoted to these issues. The structure of dissemination and communication effort, planned in WP4, provided a wide range of activities sustained by WP2 and WP3, such as international cooperation, education, training, users’ awareness and technology transfer events to research laboratories, memory institutions and industrial organizations in the heritage field, based on the main objective of the action, the contents and the targeted recipients. • Technical training events A series of trainings sessions have been carried out, primarily destined to advanced CHARISMA users. • Training on Mobile Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (28–29 April 2011, Aachen, DE) Dedicated to learn and practice the basic steps for art conservators that enabled the course participant to perform NMR analyses for investigating canvas paintings, violin bows, mummies, wall paintings etc. with the most advanced mobile NMR equipment. Technical insights on the practical use of the NMR-MOUSE (MObile Universal Surface Explorer) device and related data processing were provided. Training materials have been produced for use in the educational course. • Training on advanced laser-based techniques in art conservation, diagnostics and analysis (Heraklion, GR 18–22 June 2012). To provide an intensive, high-level training course to scientists and technicians on the fundamentals and applications of laser-based technologies used in art conservation, diagnostics and analysis. The following topics were identified: analytical laser spectroscopy (LIBS, LIF, Raman, THz); laser restoration: methodologies and real-case interventions; optical coherence metrology in structural diagnosis; and imaging and mapping: spectral and non-linear microscopy imaging. • Training on application of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to structural analysis. (27–28 June 2013, Torun, PL). The course was structured as lectures combined with hands-on sessions. Topics regarded traditional and innovative applications of OCT in archaeometry and conservation such as easel paintings, Chinese glaze, faience, historic wood, historic glass and reverse painting of glass. Hands-on training was carried out on easel paintings, jade and porcelain, and stained glass. • Training on spectroscopic techniques (invasive and non invasive) (27–29 June 2010, Ravenna, IT). Lectures combined with hands-on sessions on the role of spectroscopic techniques (XPS-SIMS, portable NMR, XRF-XRD, LIBS, μ-FTIR, μ-Raman, and others), concerning paintings, metal artefacts, mosaics, ceramics, and glasses. A methodology of use of a sequence of different analytical techniques was applied to a real case study (series of paper painted mosaic replicas). • Training on the technology of lakes preparation and dyeing textiles from botanical/animal source dyestuffs. (22-23 March 2011 Munich, DE; 30 November – 2 December, 2011, Brussels, BE). The first course “Back to the Roots - Preparation of Historical Lake Pigments” to better understanding of the nature, preparation, and use of historical lake pigments, relevant for paintings and polychromies. Participants learned to prepare lake pigments from selected red and yellow dyestuffs (madder, brazilwood, cochineal, lac dye, weld and Persian berries) according to historical recipes. Practical experiments were accompanied by theoretical presentations on the historical background of lake pigments, case studies, as well as chemistry and analytical identification of these pigments. In the second event “Dyeing with Natural Organic Colorants” the type and use of natural organic dyes for textile dyeing in preindustrial times, as well to provide a deep knowledge about the interpretation of historical recipes and practical dyeing technology was discussed. • Training on stone conservation (7-18 May 2012, Lisbon, PT; 10-21 September 2012, Torun, PL; 27 May - 7 June 2013, Amsterdam, NL). The training scheme of lecture’s main topics was stone artifact’s characterisation, their deterioration phenomena devising also suitable conservation methodologies, according to the modern conservation concepts based on diagnostics and innovative materials. Special insights were dedicated to the role of water and acid rains in the deterioration mechanisms of outdoor stone artifacts, as well as to the various aspects of biodeterioration. Restoration and maintenance strategies using the most advanced intervention techniques were extensively treated. Besides the presentations, visits to case studies were also organized. • Oriented topic events The events were an opportunity to share and compare the results obtained by the European scientific community on focused priority areas, such as the advances in a specific analytical field (techniques applied on different materials and objects). Novel methods for sampling/sample preparation; foresight studies for new instrumentation and technologies; approaches to studies of groups of objects relating to one period / one style / one (painter) artist/ one (painting) technique. • Caravaggio’s Painting Technique at OPD (17 September 2010, Firenze, IT) on the fourth centenary of the death of Caravaggio and coinciding with the exhibition &amp;#34;Caravaggio e caravaggeschi a Firenze&amp;#34; (22 May – 17 October 2010). The latest scientific studies of paintings by Caravaggio were presented to a wide international audience. Relevant aspects of recent restorations, new findings on materials and techniques, and general observations on the applied scientific methodologies were discussed. Proceedings published: M. Ciatti, B.G. Brunetti (Eds.) Caravaggio’s painting technique, Nardini Editore. ISSN: 2036-1122. ISBN: 978-88-404-4344-7. • Leonardo da Vinci’s Technical Practice at NGL (13-14 January 2012 London, UK). Coinciding with the exhibition “Leonardo da Vinci. Painter at the Court of Milan” at the National Gallery organised by NGL, C2RMF and BM. Over 300 specialists in conservation science, technical imaging, art history and curatorship, as well as invited students, attended the presentations over 2 days by world experts in Leonardo technical studies. The cross-disciplinary audience heard comprehensive studies of materials/techniques, integrated with art-historical research, including new outstanding discoveries on the practice of painters in the workshops of the Italian Renaissance. It was also an opportunity to assess latest practice in examination of paintings and drawings. Proceedings published M. Menu (Ed), Leonardo da Vinci’s Technical Practice, Hermann. ISBN: 9782705684556. • New techniques for the non-invasive investigation of the surface and subsurface structure of heritage objects at NCU (25–26 June 2013, Torun PL). The core topic was the latest developments and practical applications of non-invasive techniques to investigate the surface and sub-surface structures of cultural heritage objects. The lectures focused on the application of optical coherence tomography, terahertz spectroscopy and imaging, combined time-resolved and steady-state fluorimetry, single-sided NMR tomography and IR scanning confocal microscopy. The workshop gathered 81 participants (researchers, scientists, conservator-restorers, art historians, and archaeologists). • The Renaissance Workshop: Material and Techniques of Renaissance Art at BM (10–11 May 2012, London, UK). The workshop aimed at exploring how technical examination of Renaissance artefacts can shed light on their materials and manufacturing techniques, as well as on the prevailing European workshop practice in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. 260 participants included art historians, curators, conservators and scientists from universities, national research agencies, museums and private companies attended the workshop. Proceedings published D. Saunders, M. Spring, A. Meek (Eds), The Renaissance Workshop: The Materials and Techniques of Renaissance Art, Archetype. ISBN: 9781904982937. In the attached Fig. 4.5.1, covers of the published proceedings and posters of some of the organised events are reported (Final Report - Figures) • Foresight events Two other public events on foresight heritage sciences on “new instrumentation/ technologies” for conservation and on advanced studies of “materials and techniques” along the history of art (paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glasses, etc.) for the identification of future trends, and to promote the new applications of innovative instrumentation and methodologies studies, were also planned and held. The choice of the most promising topics were originated by proposals related to the technologies and their applications to CHARISMA activities and results. • Workshop on ‘Diagnostics in Cultural Heritage’ at the Accademia dei Lincei (17-19 November 2011, Rome, IT) dedicated to the presentation and discussion of the most advanced experimental devices and methodologies for the study and monitoring of artworks. The event was also part of the initiatives of the International Year of Chemistry 2011 (IYC 2011) and was co-organised with the Accademia dei Lincei. The programme included diagnostics in ancient, modern and contemporary art, diagnostics in conservation of books and diagnostics for the study and conservation of archaeological heritage. A final session was devoted to the demonstration of applications of the portable non-invasive tools used within MOLAB, with open discussion on their performances. The workshop registered 91 participants, mostly from universities, national research agencies, institutions of the ministry of culture, and private companies of diagnostics and restoration, including art-historians, conservators-restorers, scientists, journalists, and also public. • ‘Experience, Research and Innovation: A Research Infrastructure Platform for Cultural heritage Conservation and Restoration’ - CHARISMA Final Event. (4-5 March 2014, Firenze, IT) The organisation of the CHARISMA Final Event, led by UNIPG, APRE, and CNR-IFAC, was developed in collaboration with all partners. The event was hosted by OPD, while all the WP Leaders were involved in presenting results and chairing the various sessions, as well as in the preparation of 20 posters illustrating the activities and the main results of the project. Demonstration stands were also organised by Task Leaders. Main aim was the presentation of the activities and results of CHARISMA by emphasising the achievement of significant innovation in the heritage study and conservation, along with the disclosure of new research perspectives. The program included presentations in the Sant’Apollonia Auditorium, along with posters, bookstands, and videos’ exhibitions in the adjacent rooms, open during the whole event. Furthermore, visits to a series of stands set up at the OPD laboratories in Fortezza da Basso were also foreseen. These stands were specifically dedicated to the demonstration of performances of the instrumentations and methodologies developed within the joint research programme of the project, as: THz imaging, portable Optical Coherent Tomography, NMR-MOUSE depth-profiling, Optical Fiber Fluorescence/Absorption triple spectrometry, Optical Coherent Interferometry, FT-IR Imaging, and Laser Cleaning. The persons in charge of the research introduced the instruments, then demonstrations were carried out on the outstanding artworks currently in restoration at the Opificio delle Pietre Dure. Some pictures taken during the CHARISMA Final event in Firenze in Fig. 4.5.2 attached (Final Report - Figures). • Trade Events &amp;amp; Exhibitions Following specific invitations, CHARISMA presented the first WP9 prototypes and other project results in a comprehensive way at public events, increasing the potential for the uptake of the results. A professional stand equipped with optical windows at the Science Festival, held in Genova, IT, on 27 Oct- 7 Nov. 2010, was dedicated to the public demonstration of project laser cleaning activities managed by CNR-IFAC A CHARISMA stand was also arranged by UNIPG, NCU and APRE, at the AR&amp;amp;PA Innovation initiative of the 8th Biennial of Heritage Restoration and Management (AR&amp;amp;PA Biennial), held in Valladolid, ES, on May 24-27, 2012. The exhibition was organised by the Spanish Castilla &amp;amp; León Regional Authority, in close liaison with the European Commission and Labein-Tecnalia Research Centre and with the support of UNESCO. See in attachment the Fig. 4.5.3 where some pictures of the CHARISMA Stand at Valladolid are shown (Final Report - Figures). All these initiatives were substantial occasions to give positive hints to the research of young and senior scientists and to the diffusion of good analytical practices and common strategies. In addition, exchange of visits among consortium partners and permanence of researchers in participating institutions have been put in action under the supervision of the SC, for variable periods. Summarising, the main activities of the networking WPs were: • Defining the term dissemination, within the project context, stressing out the significant importance of this activity particularly to reach the project aims; • Producing and defining the most effective works and materials for the dissemination that are best suited for the planned goals, target groups and deliverables; • Defining the term exploitation, within the project context, to take full advantage of the consortium at the whole; • Identifying the project purposes, the internal and external available results, both from the project context, and from the single work-packages in order to make clear to internal members and potential interested parties and collaborators what can be exploited and in which way; • Defining the potential external stakeholders of the project in terms of target communities, giving a clear vision of the audience for dissemination and exploitation activities; • Capitalizing on existing collaborations and liaisons with established networks of higher cultural institutions or professional renamed associations as well as wider Cultural Heritage environment. 4.6 CHARISMA visual identity • The project logo The project logo has been designed by UNIPG with the support of the APRE graphics group exploiting a fresco of Piero della Francesca. To create a strong CHARISMA community identity and brand, all dissemination material, web, video, leaflets, deliverables doc, etc. was designed to be consistent with the adopted CHARISMA logo. It has been used the slides model, that was exploited in the material distributed during scientific meeting and conferences at national, European and international level. In the attached figure 4.6.1, the CHARISMA logo is presented (Final Report - Figures). The ‘CHARISMA style’ was then adopted by the Editor-Working Group (Editor-WG) for flyers, presentations etc., and published on line through the web (Intranet) to help consortium members in giving the project a stable image. Leaflets, communication materials, are shown and posters and roll-up, in in Figs. 4.6.2, 4.6.3 and 4.6.4. • CHARISMA videos For the occasion of EU Workshop on Research Infrastructures (March 2012) a CHARISMA dissemination video produced by APRE and UNIPG examining the material received by project’s partners, was appreciated and presented for the first time. The movie, available on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MhAwxoi1zw), provides a general overview of the project&amp;#39;s support, coordination and joint research activities, and focuses the Transnational Access opportunities and the facilities involved. The TV magazine of the European Commission, FUTURIS, introducing EU Research Projects, broadcast in seven languages and available to European and International audiences for 20 times a week (102 countries worldwide – including Japan), has dedicated (04/11/2013) a specific movie to CHARISMA activities, entitled ‘Art detectives team up’. The video included short interviews with the Coordinator, the WP7 Leader, and some transnational access user’s group leaders. The project coordinator, explained how the technology helps artists: “New advanced technology allows us to dig really deep into the nature of art objects. We can understand its structure, the evolution of the creative process used by the artist. We can also get new information about when the work of art was created. And all this with an accuracy we couldn’t even begin to imagine before now.” Fixed research facilities are often too big to relocate. When they are, it is up to the art to go on the move. The WP7 Leader scientist at C2RMF, emphasised the importance of host institutions getting everything right: “Hosting European researchers means that they travel here with their works of art. Sometimes the transportation prices and cost of insurance are breath-taking. So we, as host institutions, can’t let anything go wrong. We can’t afford to start organising such a huge effort and not deliver because of a technical failure.” The objects are placed on an unique particle accelerator, devoted exclusively to the study of works of art. The French hosts need to make sure everything is ready for their European colleagues. The movie is visible at the following link: http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/04/art-detectives-team-up In Figs. 4.6.5 and 4.6.6 some images from both videos are reported. • Press and broadcasting During the project life press and TV most significant interests were the following.

The project website One of the first achievements of CHARISMA was the establishment of a website with both a public as well as a restricted section. In order to maximize the effectiveness of the communication flow, to the CHARISMA Website has been given a flexible, networked structure. The website was based on a freely available content management system (CMS), Umbraco open-source, in full compliance with the W3C web standards. It allowed the coordinator and WP Leaders (i.e. the Steering Committee) to edit and update directly the content. The project participants suggested how to adjourn it with up-to-date information about ongoing activities and results (deliverables, publications, relevant events, news, etc.). The website URL was connected to the main search engines and directories on the web (i.e. Google, AltaVista, Yahoo, and so on). All beneficiaries contributed by providing images (big images) for the development of the home and following pages. 5.1 Public web pages The public part, with open access from the home page through specific tool buttons, included an overview of the project; the list of the facilities giving access; the consortium partners with contact information; the composition of the Steering Committee (Contacts) providing name, address and email address; the announcement the access calls; the relevant public news and events, such as scientific conferences, and the press releases, which may have been of interest for project participants. Some of snapshot of the project web attached in Figs. 5.1.1, 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 (Final Report - Figures). 5.2 Restricted sections A protected Consortium´s area was used (limited login) for internal, confidential communication enabling interaction between CHARISMA members on the activities of the project. A document sharing application has been developed, offering a useful platform to partners to share documents and files. Useful documents will be stored as well (templates, EC guidelines, reporting tools and guidance, etc.) on Document Library. An ad hoc access has been provided by using usernames and passwords. The Intranet was structured on different interlinked sites: • The principal one, the CHARISMA Consortium Area Site, mainly used as documents archive and managed by the Coordinator and accessible by all participants (the Governing Board and Steering Committee members and Team Leaders). Not only official documents of the project like Grant Agreement, Consortium Agreement, GPF etc. but also relevant material as Guidelines, Project Logos and Templates, CHARISMA Meetings (Agenda, Minute, Presentations, etc. ), were available. The specific Section called Reporting was used by all participants, permitting everyone to contribute to the preparation of Periodic Reports avoiding e-mail exchange and overloading. It was a general principle that documents should rather be uploaded and then announced by e-mail. • The WP1-10 Sites were used as autonomous working areas; each WP site was managed by the respective WP Leader and restricted to the specific WP participants, although the WP Leader had the possibility to invite additional members. The My Sites personal box, listed all sites of which the user was member, providing quick access to each of them. • A short guide also produced intends help the CHARISMA People to facilitate a quick Start for easy internal Sites navigation. 6. Measures for use and dissemination of results 6.1 Consortium agreement rules and confidentiality At the time where museums everywhere are grappling with what is culturally appropriate for data sharing, access to collections and reciprocal agreements, intellectual property (IP) appears as a guarantee of success for the scientific knowledge management. Despite the fact that IP claims surrounding CH issues can engender exclusionary practices, or unjustifiable restrictions or knowledge flows, concerns over sharing the benefits of research and unauthorised or commercial exploitation of knowledge, images, stories and designs will persist and fuel debates. The vast implication and repercussions of increased flows of ideas and information in our increasingly global and digital knowledge economy is of concern to the CHARISMA partners especially because IP issues arise between researchers and institutions or among stakeholders and information gatekeepers at the intersection of public domain, cultural knowledge and research. There is clearly much at stake regarding: i) open scientific knowledge vs ownership of knowledge; ii) restrictive vs inclusive modes of resolution; iii) rights of knowledge holders vs knowledge users; iv) legal definition vs customary definition of IP as well as the legal challenges of new technologies such as digital repositories. In this context CHARISMA partners are particularly concerned with the practical implications of flows, restrictions and appropriations of knowledge about the data handling, how these affect their access to researchers and other stakeholders, how they are defined and used and how fair and appropriate use and access can be achieved to benefit of all stakeholders. In addition to this awareness solicitation, the CHARISMA IP rules that have been prepared down within the Consortium Agreement, retained fundamental procedures associated to specific ones regarding confidentiality, ownership and exploitation of knowledge, as well as results and exploitation of results and copyrights. In developing and executing the WP8, WP9 and WP10 joint research activities, it is critical to understand the role of intellectual property and its possible impact on research and technology obtained, for a subsequent adaptation and/or further development. The principal quandary is to ensure that research innovations are issued in a timely manner and that promising directions for use are identified swiftly. In this context, the publication of scientific results originating from the joint actions of the consortium have been made as per the usual custom and practice of the CH scientific community, with the prior consent of all laboratories having contributed to results. All publications borne the statement: “The research leading to these results is partly funded by the EU Community&amp;#39;s FP7 Research Infrastructures programme under the CHARISMA Project (Grant Agreement 228330)”. WP9 and WP10 research plan was the most sensitive, considering the expected new technology instrumentations. In Plan of use and dissemination the possibility to transfer the technology (‘Products’, ‘Methods’ and ‘Experiences’) to ultimate users, i.e. to instrument’ producers, has been considered following the guidance IP rules set out in the Consortium Agreement. The users benefiting of access activities were also subject to IPs local rules of the partnership holder of the CHARISMA open facilities. In planning and conducting WP5 access activities - in which a massive pre-existing knowledge data owned and often not protected by the host Institution were open to CH professional communities - several well-known IP key points were examined and taken into account, including, among others, the confidentiality of information, the proprietary nature of materials, the property issues associated with the collaborations processes (user/host institution), and/or the research tools. The Consortium Agreement rules prevented the confidential information and data and a specific NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) was envisaged for the visits’ scientist analysing scientific data not already published. 6.2 Project output and outreach • Scientific publications relating to the activity of the project The following cumulative tables show all publications and dissemination actions from the beginning until after the end of the project, thus demonstrating the added-value and positive impact of the project. • Contacts The website, as a dissemination and communication efforts activity (WP4), is co-ordinated by APRE.

Such communities, which include trade guilds, devotional confraternities (brotherhoods), and selected chivalric orders, formed a central part of daily medieval life, especially for trades people and merchants. There are three main objectives for this project:  to identify previously unknown or unstudied liturgical books containing music for the Mass and Office (prayer services) that were demonstrably used by confraternities in geographical areas that have received almost no scholarly attention – particularly Wallonia and Northern France; to analyze the music and texts found in these new sources, and compare them with the contents of chant books from Flanders and the Netherlands that have already been studied, in order to uncover information about widespread and local religious practices; to view the results of this comparative analysis in conjunction with information derived from archival documents (accounts, membership rosters, notarial documents), and genres of popular literature written in the vernacular that are known to have circulated widely in both manuscript and print.  The combination of these approaches provide new knowledge about the social and economic circumstances in which confraternity liturgies were produced, and the role of the laity in the construction of their own devotions.\n",
       "\tSince the beginning of the project, I have spent time in the following Belgian, Dutch, and French archives: Brussels (Bibliothèque royale, Archives de la Ville), Lille (Archives du Nord, Bibliothèque municipale, Archives de la ville), Tournai (Bibliothèque du Grande Seminaire, Bibliothèque et Archives de la Cathedrale de Tournai), Namur (Musée diocesain), Cambrai (Bibliothèque municipale), Liège (Archives de l&#x27;Etat, Bibliothèque du Grande Seminaire, Eglise St. Paul), Bruges (Beguinage de Wijngaarde), Ghent (Rijksarchief); Den Haag (Koninklijke Bibliotheek);  Den Bosch (Archief Sint-Janskerk); Paris (Archives nationales, Bibliothèque nationale, Bibliothèque Mazarine), London (British Library).\n",
       "\tIn the course of the past two years, I have published 9 articles (including publications in conference proceedings, and two invited contributions for international interdisciplinary projects), been invited to give 4 guest lectures at universities in Belgium and the United States, and have delivered 5 conference papers.  The titles of these publications are provided in the attached document entitled “Publications and Presentations.”\n",
       "\tThe identification of sources and archival documents was achieved through the aid of published library catalogues and online databases, as well as on-site surveys in the institutions visited. Many of the archives in Wallonia are uncatalogued, and I had to personally contact the curators of those collections.  The archives that contained the most significant musical collections for this study are the Archives de la Cathèdrale de Tournai (4 sources for confraternities); the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the Bibliothèque Mazarine in Paris (14 sources); and the church archives of Den Bosch (4 sources).  In addition to these institutions, there were many others, which I have listed above, that had holdings of interest to the present study.\n",
       "The project carried out over the past two years has been innovative and will have lasting impact in several ways. First, this project is the first study to emphasize the chant and liturgy of confraternities in the Southern Low Countries that have so far received no attention, particularly in Wallonia and Northern France, and it provides a comprehensive analysis of liturgical books used by such organizations.  Chant is largely ignored in the historiography of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century music, as it is often overshadowed by polyphony (multi-voiced musical compositions).  Yet, chant was the most fundamental musical material of the time:  it was the music that musicians encountered first in their training; it was the basis for the church liturgy; and it was used as the foundation for sacred polyphonic compositions. Thus, research on late-medieval chant, as proposed here, has the potential to point future scholarship on the broader (and better known) repertory of medieval and Renaissance music in new directions.\n",
       "Second, the study of late medieval chant is a relatively new subject for musicologists, emerging only since the late 1980’s.  Before this, chant scholars focused primarily on the early liturgy of the Catholic Church in an attempt to understand its roots.  This early focus led to a static view of the liturgy, without taking into account the constantly evolving local chant traditions represented in liturgical books produced in the 250 years before the Council of Trent.  The present project, and the book that will result from it, greatly advances this new field of research. This expansion could open up new areas of research on the role of the liturgy in devotional communities, and the extent of influence that diocesan authorities had over their practices before the reforms of the Council of Trent.\n",
       "\tThird, as the methodological premise of this project is inherently multidisciplinary, investigating music, texts, and historical and religious context using a wide range of sources, it provides important information that purely textual analyses and religious historiography fail to indicate.  Thus, this project has the potential to influence studies of the Southern Low Countries in other disciplines such as social history, art history, literary history, liturgiology, hagiography, and codicology. \n",
       "Fourth element of lasting impact for this project is that it crosses current political and regional borders.  The result of the increasing political separation between Flanders and Wallonia in Belgium is that very few researchers who study music cross the border between these two regions, and archival collections and libraries that were once centralized have now been divided.  This is also true for studies of Northern France and the Southern Netherlands.  Before 1559, however, the dioceses of Tournai and Cambrai included all of these regions.  The present undertaking of research along modern national and regional lines is due in large part to regional and national funding constraints, which promote the study of cultural heritage only within current political boundaries. Yet this project covers not only the cultural heritage of Belgium as a whole, but also that of Northern France and the Southern Netherlands, and it witnesses their common historical heritage.  Thus Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, as political units within the European Community, could easily benefit from the results of this project, as it will validate an important aspect of their common history and contribute to efforts for its conservation and place in public education.  This has recently been a subject of intense interest within the European Union, as is evident in the international guidelines set out in 2005 at Faro, Portugal, during the Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society.

The coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating independence and 1 indicating perfect association. The empirical estimators used for Cramér&#x27;s V have been proved to be biased, even for large samples. We use a bias-corrected measure that has been proposed by Bergsma in 2013 that can be found &lt;a href=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/bergsma/pdf/cramerV3.pdf&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;row header&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=anchor-pos id=missing&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1 class=page-header&gt;Missing values&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=section-items&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;row spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;nav nav-tabs&quot; role=tablist&gt;&lt;li role=presentation class=active&gt;&lt;a href=#missing-bar aria-controls=missing-bar role=tab data-toggle=tab&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li role=presentation&gt;&lt;a href=#missing-matrix aria-controls=missing-matrix role=tab data-toggle=tab&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li role=presentation&gt;&lt;a href=#missing-heatmap aria-controls=missing-heatmap role=tab data-toggle=tab&gt;Heatmap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li role=presentation&gt;&lt;a href=#missing-dendrogram aria-controls=missing-dendrogram role=tab data-toggle=tab&gt;Dendrogram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=tab-content&gt;&lt;div role=tabpanel class=&quot;tab-pane col-sm-12 active&quot; id=missing-bar&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE svg class=&quot;img-responsive center-img&quot;PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot;\n",

Research on the delegation of political authority to IOs has recently begun to develop broader comparative data to gauge IOs’ formal power. This empirical research on the institutional design of IOs has created significant insights into the variance of IOs’ formal tasks and issue scope. Yet, two limitations make it difficult to gauge the actual power of IOs to shape global governance outcomes. First, the strong focus on the formal delegation of tasks and issue areas neglects the fact, that to be an effective player in global governance, IOs need to be equipped with the necessary capabilities to fulfil their tasks. Second, measuring IO power simply in terms of the formal rules specified in a delegation contract and similar legal documents limits our understanding of the dynamics of IO power considerably. By definition, principal-agent relationships are static. After completing the delegation contract, IO tasks, issue scope, and capabilities are expected to be fixed until further notice. Yet, empirical examples like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund suggest that IO power is much more dynamic. To address these limitations, this project offers three contributions to the literature: First, we propose a more encompassing concept of IO power, which incorporates three principal components of IO power (tasks, issue scope, and capabilities). Second, we introduce the concept of empowerment, which helps to grasp the formal and informal changes in IO power over time. Third, we introduce a novel dataset on IO capabilities, which measure the formal rules governing IOs staff and financial resources and the actual capabilities available to IOs. These original data on capabilities of six major IOs over 65 years show that capabilities vary not only across IOs but also over time. Although formal rules remain rather constant, the number of staff and the amount of financial resources, and thus the ability of IOs to shape global governance outcomes, change substantially over time.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:31:10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;312368.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DELPOWIO&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-SG-SH2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;401242&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - IONPAIRSATCATALYSIS (Design Principles of Ion Pairs in Organocatalysis – Elucidation of Structures, Intermediates and Stereoselection Modes as well as Assessment of Individual Interaction Contributions)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ion pairs are nearly omnipresent in chemistry and biochemistry and represent the key to numerous molecular functions.

Their importance and extreme impact on molecular structures are based on their intrinsic physical properties, since counter ions provide the highest energies of all intermolecular interactions and are able to bridge the longest distances. However, ion pairs also challenge scientists in many aspects. Thus, structures of small contact ion pairs based on experimental data in solution are very rare and even for the highly developed theoretical chemistry it is difficult to reproduce the subtle interplay of interactions in small organic ion pairs. As a result, in catalysis, which is the ultimate goal of synthetic chemistry, ion pair complexes are highly effective but new catalysts must be screened in a black box mode with huge effort.\\nIn this project for the first time detailed structures of ion pair catalyst complexes in Brønsted acid catalysis were provided based on a multitude of experimental data. Especially, hydrogen bonds were found to be extremely valuable sensors, which act as structural anchor in Brønsted acid catalysts and explain their broad substrate scope. Also the strength of these hydrogen bonds were correlated to the reactivity within similar structures. With chiral phosphoric acids as catalysts, four core structures were detected, which are highly conserved using different catalysts. The detailed structure investigations revealed these catalyst/substrate complexes to be by far more flexible than expected and with special NMR methods the sensitivity and the time scale could be refined to reveal even the switching of a single hydrogen bond. Furthermore, methods were developed that combine the potential of illumination, structural insight via NMR spectroscopy and UV/Vis spectroscopy and that allow an experimental access to the active transition state combinations. Overall a multitude of so far elusive structures, experimental data and methods were provided to chemists in spectroscopy, theory and synthesis to enable a refinement of concepts in ion pairing catalysis and to suggest future developments in this area.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:31:08&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;614182.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;IONPAIRSATCATALYSIS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-CG-2013-PE5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;401243&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - BACTERIAL RESPONSE (New Concepts in Bacterial Response to their Surroundings)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bacteria in nature exhibit remarkable capacity to sense their surroundings and rapidly adapt to diverse conditions by gaining new beneficial traits.

This extraordinary feature facilitates their survival when facing extreme environments. Utilizing Bacillus subtilis as our primary model organism, we studied two facets of this vital bacterial attribute: communication via extracellular nanotubes, a phenomenon we have previously discovered, and persistence as resilient spores while maintaining the potential to revive. In the past years we have made significant progress in understanding the bacterial response to their surroundings in two parallel aspects: I) the ability to communicate by producing extracellular nanotubes, and II) the capacity to reside as durable spores in response to environmental constraints and revive when possible. I will summarize our major achievements:\\nI. We have previously identified a novel type of bacterial communication mediated by tubular extensions (nanotubes) that bridge neighboring cells. Using Bacillus subtilis as a model organism, we monitored the transfer of cytoplasmic fluorescent molecules, antibiotic resistance proteins and non-conjugative plasmids among adjacent cells (Dubey and Ben-Yehuda, 2011). Within the frame of our ERC grant, we have made significant progress in understanding these bacterial adaptive strategies according to our original specific aims: 1) By combining microscopy, biochemical and genetic studies, we characterized the molecular composition of nanotubes. We defined that nanotubes are composed of chains of membranous segments harboring a continuous lumen, directly emanating from cytoplasmic membrane (Dubey et al., 2016). We further identified the phosphodiesterase YmdB, as a major component required for nanotube formation and intercellular molecular trade (Dubey et al., 2016). Moreover, we elucidated that nanotubes emerge from widespread conserved components of the flagellar export apparatus, we termed CORE, and established the CORE-derived nanotube as a ubiquitous organelle, facilitating intercellular molecular trafficking across the bacterial kingdom (Bhattacharya et al., 2019). 2) We developed strategies for observing nanotube formation in living cells, by visualizing nanotube growth and dynamics, using newly developed fluorescence tools (Dubey et al., 2016). We subsequently observed the actual nanotube-delivered molecular cargo, at a single molecule resolution, using immuno-SEM (Stempler et al., 2017) and PALM (unpublished). 3) We studied whether nanotubes mediate phage infection, and revealed non-canonical modes of phage spreading in multispecies communities (Tzipilevich et al., 2017; Habusha et al., 2019). 4) We analyzed the formation and functionality of nanotubes connecting different bacterial species, and found nanotubes to impact colony formation, to be formed between the pioneering cells establishing the colony (Mamou et al., 2016) (Mamou et al., 2017), as well as to facilitate antagonistic interactions among species (Stempler et al., 2017; Bhattacharya et al., 2019). Yet, probably our most important and surprising discovery was that host-attached pathogenic bacteria extract nutrients directly from infected human cell cytoplasm via the conserved CORE-nanotube organelle (Pal et al., 2019). \\nII. In parallel, we made important progress towards our understanding of spore robustness and their revival, by defining the entire spore revival proteome (Sinai et al., 2015), and by discovering that protein synthesis is carried out during germination, thereby fundamentally changing the current dogma of spore germination (Sinai et al., 2015). We further revealed the phosphoproteome of dormant and germinating spores for the first time (Rosenberg et al., 2015), and more recently, we found that dephosphorylation of arginine residues on key target proteins triggers germination by activating transcription and translational factors. Our results provide a whole new mechanism for spore awakening in bacteria (Zhou et al., in press). \\nThese achievements are in strong correlation with our original ERC goals.\\n\\nReferences\\nBhattacharya, S., Baidya, A.

The central experimental tool used in the project is a parabolic mirror with a depth much larger than its focal length. With such a mirror, a suitably shaped incident mode of the light field is converted into an electric-dipole wave, which is expected to maximize the coupling of light and single atoms or dipole-like quantum targets in general. In the experiments conducted in PACART, this coupling scheme has been applied for coupling light to single ions, for trapping a solid-state quantum-target, as well as for investigating nonlinear optics in a gaseous medium in an exciting and so-far unexplored regime.\\nIn the experiments with a single ion, considerable coupling efficiencies have been achieved as e.g. witnessed by the phase shift of a weak coherent state of light. Furthermore, several technologies for compensating the aberrations of deep parabolic mirrors were explored, leading the path to diffraction limited and therefore most efficient full solid angle (4π) focusing in free space.\\nThe optical trap hosting solid-state quantum targets, which is based on the same design principle as the coupling of light to a single ion, yields trapping performances much better than the ones obtained by standard focusing in free space. The successful verification of single-photon emission from the trapped nanoparticles envisions the realization of an efficient single-photon source build upon technologically relevant solid-state quantum systems.\\nAlong with these experiments on ultimate focusing, several experimental technologies applicable in – but not limited to – coupling single atoms and light in free space were developed. This includes the generation of spectrally shaped single photons by parametric down-conversion in a whispering-gallery-mode resonator and the demonstration of bright squeezed vacuum with tailored spectral properties.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:30:49&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;340625.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PACART&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-AG-PE2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;401235&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - EQUALIS (EQualIS : Enhancing the Quality of Interacting Systems)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The ubiquitous use of computerized systems, and their increasing complexity, demand formal evidences of their correctness.

While current formal-verification techniques have already been applied to a number of case studies, they are not sufficient yet to fully analyze several aspects of complex systems such as communication networks, embedded systems or industrial controllers. Several characteristics are in particular not properly taken into account so far, including the rich interaction between components, the imprecisions inherent to systems evolving in a (digital or physical) environment, and quantitative constraints that are given for instance by limited resources. The goal of the EQualIS project is to develop a rich framework to design and analyze such systems.\\n\\nAs a first outcome of the project lies a comprehensive study of rich logical formalisms allowing to express complex interactions between components: computational issues are important, but so are semantical issues, which require a foremost care! Simple interaction cases include Nash equilibria, for which we have developed efficient algorithms, even in a context with limited communication between agents (though in a deterministic setting).\\n\\nA very important challenge in the development of embedded or industrial controllers is that of robustness, which ensures the expected properties, even under small perturbations in the execution of the system. Those imprecisions may be due to internal imprecisions or to (e.g. physical) interaction with the environment. Important achievements of the EQualIS project include synthesis algorithms for time-dependent controllers which are robust to slight timing perturbations: the synthesized controller will behave correctly even if delays are slightly perturbed.\\n\\nAn important part of the project is dedicated to the evaluation of the quality of the system, with regards to specified quality evaluation criteria. While some of our results show that this is very hard to give strong evidence of the quality of a computerized system, an important achievement of the project is the development of alternative approaches like: (1) the development of monitoring or diagnosis algorithms (monitor the system online and raise an alarm if an unexpected event occurs); (2) the investigation of the dynamic complexity paradigm (when updating a model, find a non-expensive way to update the result of the analysis); and (3) the design of approximation algorithms to circumvent the unfeasibility results (approximated algorithms or almost-optimal solutions, are sufficient in practice, hence this is a fairly interesting approach for the analysis of really complex systems).\\n\\nFinally, in the EQualIS project, we demonstrated that technics from formal methods could be used in connex fields like motion planning problems or smart grids, yielding solutions (controllers) with guarantees. We also investigated further more standard controller synthesis problems, with interesting new solutions. All these applications made use of many of the aspects (with sometimes a more pragmatic approach) that we theoretically studied in other parts of the project. We also developed a tool TiAMo for the analysis of weighted timed automata.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:30:49&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FR&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;308087.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;EQUALIS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-SG-PE6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;401301&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - EARTHSEQUENCING (A new approach to sequence Earth history at high resolution over the past 66 million years)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The aims to be addressed by the project “EARTHSEQUENCING” were to overcome fundamental obstacles in generating a high-resolution and continuous fully integrated record of geological events, ages and durations (a ‘sequence of Earth history’) for the past 66 million...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The aims to be addressed by the project “EARTHSEQUENCING” were to overcome fundamental obstacles in generating a high-resolution and continuous fully integrated record of geological events, ages and durations (a ‘sequence of Earth history’) for the past 66 million years, anchored to the present, to extract properties of Earth’s and solar system orbital motion, and then to apply this time scale to solve first order questions about Earth’s climate system and Earth System sensitivity. The project bridges the long-standing ‘Eocene tuning gap’, primarily using new data recovered during Integrated Ocean Drilling Expedition 342 and integrated with a new consistent and integrated approach with existing data that currently only provide time sequences floating in time, not anchored to the present. The project is also developing major new computational tools and data collections, that will allow the scientific community to rapidly apply age-modelling and data analysis tools to extensive collated datasets.\\nThe project is organised into four components:\\n\\nObjective A: Develop the first complete cyclostratigraphic age model for the Eocene based on a single locale from IODP Exp. 342 and thus use these successions as a Rosetta Stone to close the ‘Eocene tuning gap’. Tie data into an absolute anchored chronological age model using consistent, reproducible and self-documented workflows; integrate these new age scales to provide a full Earth Sequence for the past 66 million years. This objective has now been fully achieved: High-resolution X-ray fluorescence Core data have been obtained from IODP Expedition 342 as part of a consortium effort. These data, primarily from Site U1408 and U1410 have been used to close an important time scale gap in the middle Eocene, and are currently expanded and verified by new data from IODP Site U1514 (Mantelle Basin). These new records allow the connection of previously astronomically calibrated data sets for younger and older ages, and now results in a fully connected astronomically calibrated geological time scale throughout the Cenozoic. In addition, work has been completed to arrive at the first part (latest Eocene to present) of a Cenozoic “megasplice”. Closely related data collection and interpretation of stable isotope data have been published.\\n\\nObjective B: Extract and constrain orbital components from geological data to verify, constrain and improve astronomical calculations. The aim is to reverse the traditional approach of comparing and time-adjusting geological data to pre-calculated astronomical models by first arriving at an anchored time scale based on the stable 405 kyr cycle, and then extracting unknown (tidal dissipation) or poorly constrained (obliquity) variations at and beyond the limit of validity of astronomical calculations (~50–55 Myr ago). Work on this objective is ongoing, and current progress consists of verifying a new methodology by the PI with more recent astronomical solutions, and to collect new relevant data during a field campaign in Argentina extending the approach to the Mesozoic in order to gain a larger signal-to-noise ratio of the imprint of tidal dissipation. As a corollary to this project, new progress has been made in determining the optimum data resolution in order to extract astronomical parameters from geological data. \\n\\nObjective C: Examine the magnitude (and sensitivity) of orbitally paced climate and carbon cycle dynamics across the Paleogene and test hypotheses relating to the global nature of major Eocene carbon cycle events, and Earth System Sensitivity. This sub-project started in mid-2016. Initial progress consists of setting up a relevant Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity (cGENIE, cooperation with Andy Ridgwell and Sandy Kirtland-Turner, U Riverside), and to explore sensitivity experiments with static and dynamic orbital forcings over long multi-Myr time periods. The models results are currently being prepared for publication. In addition, collaboration on background theory development and strategies resulted in a publication by von der Heydt et al., 2016.\\n\\nObjective D: Develop a new IT based “Earth sequencing” workflow that can integrate, visualise and process all relevant geological data and astronomical time series. This sub-project is the most challenging in terms of new database and numerical algorithm and software development. Major progress has been achieved on the following points: A new database system has been set up, utilising a “NoSQL” system with additional unique software compression techniques. The main outcome of this approach is that existing IODP high-resolution data sets that are used by sub-projects A-C are now organised in a comprehensive standard way, and importantly, are accessible and discoverable by algorithmic means. In particular, data access times compared to the IODP data warehouse have been increased by a factor of around 10-30, making the ambition of developing “Earth sequencing” workflows feasible. Currently about 50 GB of data have been organised, and is available via https://paloz.marum.de also for external scientists via a simplified data portal. Software development on the scientific workflow management, based on the system “Kepler” is in good progress, with initial integration of data injection from the described database system, as well as the development of new software “actors” that can ingest and process the datasets.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:32:14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;617462.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;EARTHSEQUENCING&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-CG-2013-PE10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;6&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;401285&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - PHOTOMETA (Photonic Metamaterials: From Basic Research to Applications)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The main goal of the PHOTOMETA project was to investigate Negative Index Metamaterials, Tunable Metamaterials (MMs), Photonic Crystals, Plasmonics, and Casimir forces in a unified way, aiming to identify the main challenges of the fields, to propose specific approaches to...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The main goal of the PHOTOMETA project was to investigate Negative Index Metamaterials, Tunable Metamaterials (MMs), Photonic Crystals, Plasmonics, and Casimir forces in a unified way, aiming to identify the main challenges of the fields, to propose specific approaches to attend them, and to study unexplored capabilities of those metamaterials. More specifically, the project objectives were: (a) Designing and realization of 3D optical metamaterials, and novel metasurface designs. (b) Understanding and reducing the losses in optical metamaterials by incorporating gain and electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). (c) Achieving highly efficient PC nanolasers and surface plasmon lasers. (d) Using chiral MMs and surface plasmons to reduce and manipultate the attractive Casimir and optical forces. (e) Using MMs, combined with nonlinear materials, for THz generation and tunable response. The unifying link in all these objectives is the endowment of photons with novel properties through imaginative use of electromagnetic (EM) field/artificial matter interactions. \\nTowards the achievement of the above objectives we developed different advanced simulation techniques (e.g. Finite Difference Time Domain method incorporating gain media, thin film and chiral metamaterials retrieval procedures for extraction of effective parameters of thin films and chiral media respectively etc.), and we employed them in detailed simulations, accompanied in many cases by careful experiments, which have led to some important achievements. Some of those achievements are the demonstrations of: (a) loss compensation in optical metamaterials by incorporating gain; (b) novel compact, highly controllable, efficient and low threshold lasers based of dark modes in dielectric metamaterials; (c) a novel system able to give under certain conditions repulsive Casimir force; (d) a variety of graphene-based metamaterials for THz applications (e.g. THz filter, modulator, tunable absorber, etc); (e) strong, broadband THz generation in Split-Ring Resonator metamaterials exploiting the non-linear properties of metals; (f) possibility of achieving toroidal dipolar response in dielectric metamaterials; such a response is offered for realization of new platforms for sensing, enhancing non-linearity, or even cloaking; (g) approaches to combine toroidal response in dielectric MMs with other elementary electromagnetic excitations (e.g. magnetic, dipolar-electric, etc.), expanding and advancing thus the toroidal-response based possibilities; (h) switchable chiral THz metamaterials offering great wave polarization control; (i) an approach for achieving metasurfaces offering broadband phase control (modulation larger than 2pi, with constant (high) amplitude) of the reflected or transmitted wave; such metasurfaces offer great possibilities for achievements of ultrathin optical components (for focusing, wave-steering, etc) and for broad-band group delay; the possibility and conditions to achieve parity-time symmetric chiral metamaterials; they can offer great advancement in the generation and control of circularly polarized waves; (i) high-quality resonant optical metamaterials by exploiting the dark modes of dielectric resonators, and avoiding the high losses inherent into metals.\\nRegarding photonic crystals, we demonstrated also extremely low-threshold lasing in 2D finite photonic crystals (PCs), exploiting not only the modified density of states provided by the PC but also the easily engineerable modal reflectivity at the interfaces between the PC and its surrounding medium. Moreover, we demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally directional emission, frequency splitter operation, and beam collimation with enhanced transmittance in finite 2D photonic crystals and PC-based structures by modifying properly the structure termination.\\nAll the above results, which have been communicated in many papers and many conferences, pave the way for novel metamaterial and PC related components. Such components can be exploited in a variety of applications, including low threshold lasers, novel components for THz generation and manipulation, novel platforms for beam shaping, steering and manipulation, novel platforms for sensing, security and energy harvesting, and in many other applications areas where wave-matter interaction is a key issue.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:31:53&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;EL&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;320081.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PHOTOMETA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-AG-PE3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;401281&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - CHRONOS (A geochemical clock to measure timescales of volcanic eruptions)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The extent to which volcanic eruptions can be adequately assessed depends on how the underlying physical conditions and processes are understood.

In the last years, our planet has been affected drastically by volcanic eruptions in a unique way in history. Eyjafjall (2010) and Grímsvötn (2011) volcanoes in Iceland and Calbuco (2015) volcano in Chile paralysed air traffic in Europe and South America demonstrating the enormous impact of even relatively low energy volcanic eruptions on a globalized society. In order to be prepared for all eventualities of future eruptions, we must understand not only how volcanoes work, but also quantify the eruptive timescales. \\n The ERC Consolidator Grant CHRONOS “A geochemical clock to measure timescales of volcanic eruptions” was an interdisciplinary project designed to address one of the most fundamental, yet poorly constrained, variable of volcanic eruptions: time. The project was hosted at the University of Perugia (Italy) and was composed by a group of scientists with different background (geologists, petrologists, geochemists, mineralogists, experimentalists, geophysicists) working together towards the common objective of determining timescales of explosive volcanic eruptions. \\n The most energetic eruptions occurred on planet Earth in the last two centuries have been triggered by refilling of a felsic volcanic magma chamber by a hot and more mafic magma, causing mixing between magmas. CHRONOS used the compositional heterogeneity produced by magma mixing, and frozen in time in the rocks, the same way a broken clock at a crime scene can be used to determine the time of the incident. In order to read this clock, the physico-chemical processes governing the mixing process must be well understood. \\n During the five years of CHRONOS project activities we have: a) carried out field campaigns and sample collection on a representative number of active volcanoes (Mt. Vesuvius, Phlegrean Fields, Aeolian Islands, Soufriere Hills, Mt. Calbuco) to study the compositional variability triggered by mixing before/during eruptions; b) designed and building a unique experimental device (the ChaOtic Magma Mixing Apparatus, COMMA) that can replicate with precision the magma mixing process at conditions relevant for volcanic systems; c) installed a state-of-the-art laboratory for the high-resolution geochemical analyses of the composition of both natural and experimental samples; d) defined empirical relationships, obtained from magma mixing experiments and based on the relative mobility of chemical elements, to determine the time elapsed between the onset of magma mixing and beginning of eruptions.\\n These lines of integrated research have been creating an unprecedented knowledge into the physical and chemical conditions characterizing magma mixing. This allowed us to build the first chronometer for volcanic eruptions based on the use of many chemical elements converging to the same timescale. The application of this chronometer to estimate eruption timescales allowed us to estimate eruption timescales for different active volcanoes, including the Phlegrean Fields, the island of Vulcano and Mt. Vesuvius volcano (Italy) and Sete Cidades Volcano (Sao Miguel island; Azores). We discovered that the time separating the starting of mixing at depth and eruptions was of the order of a few hours to minutes. These results have implications for civil protection planning of future volcanic crisis because these short timescales may imply little warning in volcanic crises. We anticipate our findings to be a reference point towards a unifying model explaining chemical exchanges in magmatic systems and supplying information on the use of chemical element mobility as geochronometers for volcanic eruptions. CHRONOS results provided unparalleled clues for building an inventory of past and recent volcanic eruption timescales and will be decisive for hazard assessment in active volcanic areas.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:31:49&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;IT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;612776.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CHRONOS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-CG-2013-PE10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;401305&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - HICCUP (High Impact Cross-section Calculations for Unprecedented Precision)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A main outcome of the project has been the development of an event generator for two-to-one and two-to-two scattering processes that is accurate at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and includes parton-shower corrections.

Depending on the process considered, a significant reduction of the theoretical errors, by a factor 2-4, has been achieved compared to previous event generators that were accurate at next-to-leading order (NLO) and included parton-shower corrections. A second main achievement of the project has been to push the frontier of next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) resummations to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level (NNLL), thereby achieving a considerable reduction of uncertainty for important final state observables, including event-shapes and jet-rates. A large number of phenomenological studies have been carried out as a spin-off of the project.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:32:20&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;614577.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;HICCUP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-CG-2013-PE2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;9&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;401303&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - INVARIANTCLASS (Invariant Representations for High-Dimensional Signal Classifications)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Machine learning over large size signals such as images or time-series requires to reduce the data dimensionality without eliminating information for classification or regression tasks.

One can perform such a dimensionality reduction from prior information about invariant properties of classification or regression problems. The InvariantClass project developed new multiscale invariant representations, for supervised and unsupervised learning. \\n\\nWe introduced the wavelet scattering transform, which is invariant to signal translations and stable to deformations. Scattering coefficients are computed with a deep neural network architecture, by cascading wavelet filters and non-linear modulus. This representation was generalised to define invariants over larger groups of transformations, including rotations, scalings and frequency shifts, while preserving stability to deformations. A scattering transform provides a mathematical model for the first layers of deep convolutional neural networks.\\n\\nWe studied the applications of scattering invariant descriptors to a wide range of classificaiton and regression problems, for images, audio and bio-medical signals as well as financial time-series. We also showed that these invariants provide appropriate representations to linearly regress quantum molecular energies over large data-bases. All algorithms are implemented in open source softwares, which are widely distributed for research and industrial applications.\\n\\nScattering invariants have also been applied to unsupervised learning. A first applications concerned signals defined over a graph whose topology is learned from data. We then concentrated on estimations of stochastic models of data distributions. We introduced maximum entropy models conditioned by scattering invariants, to caracterize non-Gaussian processes having long range interactions. We studied applications to generative models of image and audio textures, as well as multifractal models of physical processes such as turbulent flows, and to financial time-series. \\n\\nScattering transforms have been extened by incorporating phase information, with rectifier non-linearities. The introduction of phase has considerably improved models of coherent geometric structures. It is applied to approximate the geometry of point processes. More complex geometries have been addressed with a dictionary learning algorithm over scattering coefficients. It provides a mathematical approach to understand signal generation with convolutional autoencoders.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2019-08-13 15:32:14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FR&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;320959.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;INVARIANTCLASS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-IDEAS-ERC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ERC-AG-PE6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;row spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=indent&gt;Last rows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=sample-container class=col-sm-12&gt;&lt;table border=1 class=&quot;dataframe sample table table-striped&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;rcn&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;language&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;title&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;teaser&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;summary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;workPerformed&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;finalResults&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;lastUpdateDate&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;country&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;projectID&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;projectAcronym&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;programme&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;topics&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;relatedFile&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;url&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22191&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47597&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - ESTSPLINE (Educational, scientific, and technological aspects of splines)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The ESTSPLINE grant contributed to three different sets of activities related to Dr Ewald Quak&#x27;s scientific research field of 3D geometric modelling: \\n 1. development of the Laboratory of Wave Engineering (please see http://wavelab.ioc.ee online) as a new part of the Center fo...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The ESTSPLINE grant contributed to three different sets of activities related to Dr Ewald Quak&#x27;s scientific research field of 3D geometric modelling: \\n 1. development of the Laboratory of Wave Engineering (please see http://wavelab.ioc.ee online) as a new part of the Center for Nonlinear Studies (CENS, please see http://cens.ioc.ee online) within the Institute of Cybernetics (IoC, please see http://www.ioc.ee online) at Tallinn University of Technology (TUT, please see http://www.ttu.ee online) in Estonia; \\n 2. investigations of industrial applications of 3D geometry and road maps for future research in this subject area; \\n 3. initialisation of a 3D scientific visualisation capacity within CENS. \\n\\n Apart from publishing articles in scientific journals, Dr Quak was the editor (with T. Soomere) of the edited volume &#x27;Applied wave mathematics - Selected topics in solids, fluids, and mathematical methods&#x27;, published by Springer, containing 12 tutorials to highlight the importance of applied mathematics in the studies of wave phenomena. He was also guest editor for the special issue &#x27;3D physiological human&#x27; of the journal The Visual Computer, together with Prof. Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann (University of Geneva, Switzerland). \\n\\n 1. The Laboratory of Wave Engineering was formally established as a new research unit in January 2009. The team focuses on complex and nonlinear phenomena in wave dynamics and coastal engineering, and the applications of mathematical methods in wave studies. The team is led by Prof. Tarmo Soomere, a member of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, with Dr Quak as senior researcher. As of June 2011, it has 17 members. \\n\\n National and international research grants are vital for the development of the team. The currently most significant is BalticWay (the potential of currents for environmental management of the Baltic Sea maritime industry), for which Dr Quak is a member of the organising team and serves as dissemination manager, and which is coordinated by Prof. Soomere (please see http://wavelab.ioc.ee/bonus-balticway online). \\n\\n The main part of the ESTSPLINE grant was used to establish and run a secretariat for the laboratory, paying two administrative / research assistants: Anna Terentjeva and Katri Kartau. The importance of guaranteeing a well-functioning administrative nucleus for the inception and initial development of the laboratory simply cannot be overerestimated. It is also important to note that the assistants&#x27; duties also included research contributions. \\n\\n 2. In 2010, Dr Quak became a member of the editorial board of the newly established Journal of Mathematics in Industry, a peer-reviewed, open access journal that focuses on new developments in mathematics for industrial applications. \\n\\n Since 2003, Dr Ewald Quak has been co-organising annual workshops on industrial challenges in geometric modelling, computer aided design, and simulation, the most recent ones partially sponsored by ESTSPLINE, promoting the cooperation of industry and academia in addressing relevant and challenging mathematical problems from geometry, computer-aided design, shape modelling, and simulation. \\n\\n For the Geometric Design Activity Group of SIAM (please see http://www.siam.org/activity/gd/ online), Dr Quak organised forward looking sessions and moderated plenary panel discussions at the group&#x27;s biennial conferences on geometric design in 2007, 2009, and 2011, partially supported by ESTSPLINE. The goal is to have experts suggest topics for future research, which are scientifically challenging and of practical industrial relevance. \\n\\n 3. The concept of a 3D visualisation system was developed jointly by Dr Ewald Quak and Dr Heiko Herrmann and partially funded by their re-integration grants ESTSPLINE and ESTWAVE. The aim was to establish a 3D visualisation system for scientific data at CENS, which has not existed there before. \\n\\n Contact Information: \\n Dr Ewald Quak - email: Ewald.Quak@cs.ioc.ee \\n Senior Researcher - Laboratory of Wave Engineering \\n Center for Nonlinear Studies (CENS) - Institute of Cybernetics (IoC) at Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia \\n Telephone: +372-5330-3224&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2018-07-13 16:28:00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;EE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;224819.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ESTSPLINE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEOPLE-2007-2-2.ERG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;/docs/results/224/224819/124178641-6_en.pdf&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22192&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47674&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Periodic Report Summary - TIGJET (Development of sol-gel inkjet inks for printing on glass substrates for architectural applications)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;In the project TIGJET, the research fellow and TIGER Coatings set a goal to develop a new class of sol-gel inkjet inks which opens a new way of manufacturing individually designed flat glass for outdoor applications as currently used screen printing technology is economically ...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;In the project TIGJET, the research fellow and TIGER Coatings set a goal to develop a new class of sol-gel inkjet inks which opens a new way of manufacturing individually designed flat glass for outdoor applications as currently used screen printing technology is economically inefficient, very inflexible and often of poor image quality. A new class of sol-gel inkjet inks shows on the one hand an excellent adhesion on glass and on the other hand withstands exterior weathering conditions which are typical for permanent usage on facades over years. To achieve this very challenging goal, we have decided to investigate two different routes to develop inks that can fulfil the requirements with regards to adhesion on substrate and weathering performance. \\n\\n a) Development of inorganic-organic hybrid sol-gel inkjet inks that can be fused into the surface of glass panel at elevated temperatures and can be printed without nozzle failure. \\n b) Development of &#x27;inorganic&#x27; sol-gel inkjet inks; ideally water based. \\n\\n Development of the sol-gel inkjet inks has been performed according to the description of work in the project proposal. The work was divided into three directions: development of organic-inorganic hybrid inks, inorganic sol-gel inks and water-based sol-gel inks. \\n\\n Long-term stable dual curable organic-inorganic hybrid sol-gel inkjet inks based on UV-curable organofunctional silanes applicable with major industrial piezo print heads have been developed. The novelty of the developed sol-gel compositions lie in the using of UV-light initiated hydrolysis of organosilanes directly during UV-curing of the inks after their jetting onto glass surface. In this way, it is possible to avoid complications usually occurring when using traditional sol-gel processing of the organosilanes by prehydrolysing of them before inkjet inks composing that leads to the uncontrollable condensation of organosilica networks with time. The last is dangerous for print heads controllable performance due to their blockage during operation or in the stand by mode. \\n\\n Developed hybrid sol-gel inkjet inks have superior adhesion on glass surface after their thermal treatment at temperatures 160-200 degrees Celsius and extended exposure to high humidity environment (more than 1000 hrs at 40 degrees Celsius, 100 % RH). Hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel inkjet inks have been developed using set of organic colours (organic pigments) of CMYK and white range. In order to improve outdoor stability of the developed sol-gel ink-jet inks towards UV-light, inorganic pigments were also incorporated in the compositions. \\n\\n Printing trials of the sol-gel inkjet inks have proved their stable printing characteristics. Print head nozzles&#x27; blockage has not been observed even after long breaks between jetting sessions up to 72 hrs. \\n\\n The results obtained during development of the hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel inkjet inks have been further used when working on the development of inorganic sol-gel inks for fusion into glass surface at elevated temperatures. As we have already figured out the most applicable organofunctional silanes to compose inkjet inks with long-term stable rheological behaviour, they were used to create on their basis inorganic sol-gel inkjet inks. \\n\\n Extensive experimental trials in the sol-gel films deposition and their thermal treatment at elevated temperatures (&amp;gt; 650 degrees Celsius) showed that the components reducing melting temperature of silica should be added into the composition to achieve coatings capable for fusing into glass surface. \\n\\n Inorganic sol-gel inkjet inks have been developed on the basis of UV-curable organofunctional alkoxysilane as inorganic matrix source and glass frit concentrate ensuring melting of the silica matrix and fusing of the coating with inorganic colours into glass. Obtained coatings have extremely high resistance against high humidity environment as well as against UV-light degradation as they are 100 % inorganic systems after firing at temperatures higher than 650 degrees Celsius. As was expected continuous mixing of the systems helps to control sedimentation of the inks due to the high content of the inorganic materials with high density. \\n\\n To implement ceramic sol-gel inkjet inks into practice further research is necessary to achieve complete stabilisation of inorganic colours in the sol-gel systems as well as to obtain long term rheological stable inks. \\n\\n Waterborne sol-gel inkjet inks on the basis of inorganic silica binder with organic and inorganic colour sources have been developed. Incorporation of water dispersible acrylic oligomers as well as photoinitiators allows us realising for this type of sol-gel systems &#x27;drop-fixation&#x27; mechanism. Sol-gel compositions with organic colours show appropriate long term stability of rheological properties. Addition of high boiling point solvents into the system improves open time properties of the inks. \\n\\n From the application point of view first two classes of sol-gel inkjet inks are the most perspective as by using developed organic-inorganic hybrid sol-gel inkjet inks one may obtain photographic print quality during wide format inkjet printing on glass surface. Depending on the colour system used in the inks (organic pigments or inorganic pigments) UV-light stability of the printed patterns can be adjusted for indoor or outdoor usage. On the other hand, developed inorganic sol-gel inkjet inks for fusing into glass surface have perspective to be implemented into manufacture of inkjet patterned tempered glass process as an alternative to screen printed tempered glass. Their lower content of the abrasive inorganic particles will lead to longer operation time of the print heads. \\n\\n Industrial application of the developed sol-gel inkjet inks for exterior applications opens new possibilities of manufacture of individual designed entire facades and this makes the material glass more attractive and will lead to increased business activities for the participating European companies in the worldwide market. There is a global demand of innovative and attractive architectural design. Today, there is no technology available of printing long term stable colourful images on exterior glass. However, there is a very clear market demand for such type of products. European companies will lead the worldwide market for decorative architectural glass for exterior application. If it is becoming feasible to print images by inkjet on glass instead of using screen printing processes there are many obvious advantages. Cost of individual design could significantly be reduced as costly screens are no longer required. Digital direct printing by inkjet will speed up the manufacturing process enormously. Images printed by inkjet should show better resolution and much wider colour space than today available inorganic screen printing inks. These innovations will also boost the entire European glass industry as new market segments for flat glass will be opened up using inkjet printing as finishing step. Both printer manufacturers and raw materials suppliers will also recognize positive economical impacts. While the firsts will be able to sell more printers in the industrial sector, the latter will face an increased demand for certain chemical compounds.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2018-07-13 16:43:19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;235923.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;TIGJET&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE-IIF-2008&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22193&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47419&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - 2MODEACHIP (Interacting two-component quantum gases in micro-magnetic traps)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dr Whitlock&#x27;s MC-IIF fellowship has been extremely productive.

He has been the leading postdoc on two experimental setups, and co-supervised four PhD students, resulting in a number of scientific achievements advancing cold atom technology and motivating new research directions. This has been recognised by numerous invited seminars at world leading research institutes and contributions to many international conferences. \\n\\n In one set of experiments we have realised a vast two-dimensional array of trapped ultracold atom clouds, using a magnetic-film atom chip. We have loaded atoms into hundreds of tightly confining and optically resolved array sites and cooled the atoms to quantum degeneracy. We have shown that rapid density-dependent three-body atom loss in these microtraps is a robust way to prepare small ensembles comprising tens to hundreds of atoms each. Arrays of trapped atoms are the ideal starting points for developing scalable quantum registers for storing and processing quantum information. \\n\\n This is also an ideal environment to investigate collective excitations via laser excited Rydberg states to engineer many-body interactions. We first demonstrated spatially resolved, coherent excitation of Rydberg atoms on an atom chip. Ultracold atoms excited to high-lying Rydberg states allow for long-range atom-atom interactions and can greatly enhance atom-surface interactions. We measure distance-dependent shifts of the Rydberg energy levels caused by local electric fields near the gold-coated chip surface. This indicates the presence of a localised patch of Rb adsorbates on the chip surface. Our results will allow for further studies of atom-surface interactions, many-body physics and quantum information science involving interacting Rydberg excited atoms on atom chips. \\n\\n In the same experiment, we have improved the detection of trapped atom ensembles through advanced postprocessing and optimal analysis of laser-illuminated absorption images. We show how to maximise the information extracted from typical absorption images which can significantly improve the readout of trapped atom interferometers, or better resolve number squeesing and entanglement between atomic ensembles. The methods were also applied to probe sub-Poissonian number statistics in a lattice of small atomic ensembles. A number of other groups have shown great interest in our results and have started to implement some of our algorithms. \\n\\n Another set of experiments were performed using an apparatus for the study of one-dimensional (1D) quantum gases on an atom chip. We introduced radio-frequency (rf) dressed potentials to enable additional flexibility for manipulating quantum gases. We demonstrated that state-dependent rf dressing is a new way to control interactions and non-equilibrium spin-dynamics in two-component 1D quantum gases. We have prepared coherent superpositions of both spin and motional degrees of freedom in a weakly interacting 1D Bose gas. We directly image non-equilibrium spin dynamics following a sudden change in the system parameters. The experimental control over the spin dynamics includes access to the point of spin-independent interactions where exact quantum many-body solutions are available. These results are relevant for our understanding of complex many-body phenomena such as spin waves, spin-charge separation and the relation between superfluidity and magnetism. Tunable interactions in two-component quantum gases have important applications in the areas of spin squeezing and quantum metrology, and the control of spin dynamics opens new avenues for studies of quantum coherence in interacting quantum systems. \\n\\n In addition to the main research program Dr Whitlock also initiated a successful ongoing international research collaboration (Roman Schmied, MPQ Garching; now University Basel), signing the corresponding paper as the senior author.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2018-07-13 15:40:12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NL&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;220794.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2MODEACHIP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEOPLE-2007-4-2.IIF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22194&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47257&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - 43CAQIP (High fidelity quantum gates with trapped 43Ca+ ions)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The discovery that information processing based on the laws of quantum mechanics could be more powerful than its classical counterpart started the field of quantum information processing and led to investigations of the role of information in quantum theory. In quantum informa...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The discovery that information processing based on the laws of quantum mechanics could be more powerful than its classical counterpart started the field of quantum information processing and led to investigations of the role of information in quantum theory. In quantum information processing, the basic unit of information is a quantum bit or &#x27;qubit&#x27; comprised of two energy levels. In a quantum bit, information is encoded as superpositions of two basis states. Similar to classical computing, any quantum calculation can be decomposed into a sequence of elementary gate operations consisting of gates that act on single quantum bits and pairs of quantum bits and that coherently transform the quantum state. These gates require coherent coupling between the different qubits, one example being the quantum counterpart to the classical XOR gate, i.e. the quantum controlled-not (CNOT) gate that can be used to entangle two qubits. \\n\\n Trapped ions are a prime candidate for performing quantum information tasks. In these quantum computation schemes, qubits are encoded in long-lived internal states of the ions. The quantum optics and spectroscopy group in Innsbruck led by Prof. Blatt, where the project was carried out, is a leading group in the field of quantum information science in trapped ions. The objective of the research project was to implement high-fidelity quantum gate operations in trapped ions with the purpose of investigating simple quantum algorithms and creating multi-particle entanglement. For this it was proposed to investigate two different ionic species, both isotopes of Ca+. One of these, 43Ca+, offers a qubit system that is immune to magnetic field fluctuations, a prime reason for decoherence in other experiments. Furthermore, a number of laser based operations were proposed to investigate the quality of entangling operations. \\n\\n We implemented a two ion entangling gate to produce Bell states with the highest fidelity so far (99.3 %) at the start of the project. The gate has also been used on thermal ions, i.e. without ground-state cooling. This result is of key importance for scalable quantum computing, as this generally requires operations that heat up the ion strings. The gate can be readily extended to a larger number of ions and we have investigated schemes with three ions, which open up the possibility of implementing quantum error correction. We also entangled two ions of the isotope 43Ca+ and measured coherence times exceeding the entangling operation by a factor of 103 by encoding in two clock states. \\n\\n The implementation of the high fidelity entangling gate has opened up many possibilities for exciting research. One of the most striking implementation of the entangling gate was a test of quantum contextuality on trapped ions, which was performed halfway the project. Discussions on whether quantum mechanics can be explained by classical models based on hidden variables date back a long time. A well-known property of hidden variable theories that has been tested in experiments is locality. Contextuality is the notion that compatible measurements should have outcomes that do not depend on each other. We tested this property using a pair of trapped ions, while closing the detection loophole. The corresponding scientific paper was published in the journal Nature. \\n\\n Contributions were also made in the flourishing field of quantum simulation. Quantum simulation aims at simulating quantum systems that are experimentally inaccessible and that cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers, in controlled laboratory systems. A number of simulations were performed involving the motion of the trapped ions, and the researcher was also involved in theoretical work in this field, in collaboration with a theory group in Spain led by Prof. E. Solano and Dr Garcia-Ripoll. Using trapped ions we performed a quantum simulation of a relativistic particle described by the Dirac equation.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2018-07-13 14:17:30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;220105.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;43CAQIP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEOPLE-2007-2-1.IEF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;/docs/results/220/220105/123238261-19_en.doc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22195&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47623&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - WNT IN THE INTESTINE (Wnt signalling in colorectal carcinogenesis and intestinal homeostasis)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.

Using flies and mice to model intestinal homeostasis and transformation \\n\\n We have developed a Drosophila model of CRC, which is providing great insight into the mechanisms involved in the disease. Furthermore, our results highlight that intestinal regeneration and transformation share many commonalities. \\n\\n Using RNA interference and loss of function alleles we knocked down Apc1 from the adult Drosophila intestine. Our results indicate that Apc1 is not redundant to Apc2 in the Drosophila midgut, and that its depletion is sufficient to trigger ISC proliferation and hyperplasia in the midgut epithelium. This phenotype highly resembles that of the mammalian intestine, indicating a significant degree of evolutionary conservation in the biology of this tissue (Cordero et al., 2009). Therefore, this should act as an excellent system to identify key downstream signalling events following Apc1 loss. \\n\\n We have performed microarray analysis from Apc1 deficient Drosophila midguts. We have identified many genes and pathways that are mis-regulated upon Apc1 loss. We have demonstrated that Jak/Stat signalling and Myc are activated and required for ISC proliferation following Apc1 loss. Furthermore, we show that parallel activation of Wnt/Myc and Jak/Stat signalling is essential for ISC proliferation during tissue regeneration and that Wg secreted from the intestinal epithelium is required for this process. Our results uncover an intimate connection between Wnt/Myc and Jak/Stat signalling, which mediates ISC proliferation during tissue regeneration as well as in transformation (Cordero et al., 2011; under review). \\n\\n Using flies and mice we have demonstrated that Src hyperactivation is sufficient to drive ISC hyperproliferation and intestinal hyperplasia. Furthermore, activation of Src is required for intestinal regeneration in response to damage and hyperplasia following Apc loss. \\n\\n We expect our work will lead to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways involved in intestinal homeostasis, regeneration and transformation. Therefore our results hold great potential for the development of targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) therapies as well as for regenerative medicine. \\n\\n 2. Role of the immune system in tumor progression and invasion \\n\\n Using a genetically defined Drosophila tumor model, we showed that TNF acts as a tumour promoter in the context of RasV12; scrib-/- tumors. Furthermore, TNF was expressed by tumour-associated haemocytes and such expression was necessary and sufficient for pathway activation in tumour cells. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights explaining the contrasting roles of the immune system in tumourigenesis and suggesting a strong dependency on the genetic composition of the tumour (Cordero et al., 2010). We aim to translate these results to our fly and mouse models of colorectal cancer.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2018-07-13 16:32:24&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;UK&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;235848.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;WNT IN THE INTESTINE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE-IEF-2008&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;/docs/results/235/235848/124178721-8_en.zip&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22196&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47585&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - TOLLICOR (Dissecting pathogen recognition complexes of Toll-like receptors: hunting for new co-receptors and ligands)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final publishable summary report \\n\\n Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane bound receptor proteins that recognise pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and are part of the first line of defence against an invading pathogen.

Whereas the TLRs for the recognition of bacterial surface molecules localise to the plasma membrane of a cell, the TLR mediated sensing of foreign nucleic acids derived from e.g. bacteria or viruses is taking place in the endosome and is mediated by TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9. To broaden our understanding on the mechanisms of TLR action and pathogen recognition we set out to identify novel interactors of endosomal TLRs. To this end, we cloned tagged versions of murine endosomal TLRs and transduced them into RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Tandem affinity purification with those receptors has been performed and enriched receptor complexes have been analysed by mass spectrometry. Using the support of our bioinformatics department seven high confidence interacting proteins were selected for further validation as putative novel interactors of endosomal TLRs. \\n\\n The first protein we validated was the well known macrophage surface marker and well studied co-factor of TLR4, the innate immune receptor for lipopolysaccharide from gram negative bacteria. Using confocal imaging and immunoprecipitation experiments we were able to confirm the interaction of CD14 with all four endosomal TLRs. In studies using cells that express TLR9 but not CD14 we could show that recombinant CD14 that was added to the cell culture medium was able to multiply the pro-inflammatory effect in response to the TLR9 ligand, indicating that CD14 would promote the signalling from endosomal TLRs. In contrast, macrophages and dendritic cells from CD14 deficient mice showed reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon challenge with the ligands for TLR7 / TLR9, confirming the pro-inflammatory role of CD14 in endosomal TLR signalling. \\n\\n In further studies, we embarked on the mechanism of CD14 and found that it is required for the uptake of fluorescently labeled DNA into the macrophages endosome. This reduced delivery of ligand into TLR containing endosome could explain the reduced stimulatory effects of TLRs in CD14 deficient immune cells. However, to further investigate the function of CD14 in the endosome we investigated its role in the uptake of bacteria and viruses and found that - at least for those tested - CD14 was dispensable. Yet, incubation of CD14 deficient cells with TLR7 stimulating viruses (influenza, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)) led to a severely reduced pro-inflammatory response compared to WT cells. Interestingly, VSV-M2, a variant of VSV that is recognised rather in the cytoplasm and not by TLR7, showed comparable levels of pro-inflammatory cyrokines in CD14 deficient and control cells. This shows that CD14 has 2 roles in the endosome: it promotes the uptake of nucleic acids and it functions as a coreceptor of endosomal TLRs in signalling. \\n\\n Further interactors that we have found in the TOLLLICOR screen are under investigation. The project that describes CD14 function in endosomal TLR signalling is of great interest for the scientific and medical community: toll-like receptors are at the forefront of the recognition of pathogens by the innate immune system. Diseases like sepsis, autoimmune disease, cancer and vaccination are closely linked to these proteins and endosomal TLRs. Cd14 is a protein that might allow to tune immune response e.g. to influenza virus, other pathogens or the immune recognition of self-DNA in autoimmune disorders. We have also shown that soluble recombinant CD14 protein can enhance endosomal TLR activation; in addition, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the ectodomain of CD14 can block such response. These are potential therapheutic approaches in the modulation of endosomal TLR signalling. \\n\\n The work was carried out at: \\n\\n Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) \\n Lab of Prof. Giulio Superti-Furga \\n CeMM - Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences \\n Lazarettgasse 14 / AKH BT 25.3 \\n A-1090 Vienna \\n http://www.cemm.at&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-02-16 13:16:05&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;220596.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;TOLLICOR&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEOPLE-2007-2-1.IEF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;/docs/results/220/220596/124178701-6_en.pdf&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22197&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47593&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - BIOLAC (Toward Biodiversity Conservation, Sustainable Use and Benefit-Sharing in Latin America and the Caribbean)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Global biodiversity loss has been identified as one of the key environmental challenges of our time.

Most of the world&#x27;s biodiversity &#x27;hotspots&#x27; are to be found in the developing world; indeed, one of the major assets of the region identified as Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is its biological wealth, with Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in particular as one of the sites were global biodiversity is most in danger. It is therefore essential that we assess the interactions between biodiversity and human well-being in the very countries and regions that are both directly determining its loss by explicit economic decision-making and may also bear the brunt of the consequences of such loss. This was the fundamental objective of the BIOLAC project. \\n\\n The project offers a framework for a pre-testing stage of environmental valuation in developing countries, and discusses this with specific reference to SIDS. Existing, aggregate global biodiversity indicators are downscaled to a study of SIDS, where an analysis is conducted that links such indicators of biodiversity change to the ecosystem services they support, and ultimately to the human livelihoods dependent upon these services. A comprehensive review of the literature on the valuation of the recreational, cultural and aesthetic services of these ecosystems, and the implications of these findings for SIDS, is discussed. \\n\\n The case study selected was the remote village of Grande Riviere on the north-eastern coast of the island of Trinidad, the beach of which is the location of one of the major nesting sites of leatherback turtles, around which there is the fledgling development of an eco-tourism industry. The significant role of tourism and eco-tourism in the economic life of SIDS, and the role of biodiversity in these industries, is empirically investigated using panel data techniques. The sometimes competing roles of tourism and fisheries with respect to biodiversity resources in the context of SIDS is empirically investigated. \\n\\n The methodologies associated with linking marine turtles, ecosystem services and human welfare is discussed from an inter-disciplinary perspective with the use of the ecosystem service categories of the millennium ecosystem assessment. The BIOLAC project created and administered four survey instruments, targeting the local community, local and national visitors to the village, and airport tourists. The relationship between the community and nature is empirically analysed. The community views on the existing and potentially expanding eco-tourism industry, community preferences for further penetration into this industry, and the factors that characterise and determine these preferences are studied. The existing and potential levels of demand for this eco-tourism product is investigated. \\n\\n A joint analysis is conducted to analyse welfare distributional changes of biodiversity loss in Grande Riviere. A stock-taking exercise is conducted of attitudes of the Grande Riviere community to the issue of climate change. An empirical analysis is conducted of the methods of communication that currently have the most impact the Grande Riviere community in the context of climate change issues, and therefore represent the best channels of further education on climate change, with an aim to adaptation and mitigation strategies. Based on the experiences of the BIOLAC project, model revisions are suggested with explicit reference to challenges encountered and resolved. Finally, a toolkit is produced that outlines a roadmap for research applications to other case studies of the LAC region.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2018-06-12 18:49:36&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;IT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;221126.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;BIOLAC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEOPLE-2007-4-2.IIF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;/docs/results/221/221126/124178591-6_en.pdf&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22198&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47263&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - QOSC2007 (Coupling of trapped ions via normal metal and superconductor transmission lines)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Introduction: \\n Trapped ions offer a unique system for the study of quantum information and constitute one of the most promising candidates for the implementation of a quantum computer.

Extreme control of their quantum state, quantum gates and elementary algorithms have been demonstrated. Currently, several different schemes for the transfer of quantum information, the information encoded in the electronic state of a trapped ion, are being explored, with the aim of constructing a scalable quantum computer. Our motivation in this project was to provide a solid-state quantum bus for trapped ions, in order to couple the motional states of distant trapped ions. This route is of great technological and fundamental importance, extending beyond the scope of ion-trap quantum computation. It will allow the coupling of atomic systems to mesoscopic solid-state systems, a very active field of research. In addition, it can give rise to a new set of experimental tools for studying electronic transport and noise in normal metals and superconductors. \\n\\n Trap fabrication: \\n One key requirement in ion trap technology is the availability of micro-fabricated ion traps. A decrease in the size of ion traps is necessary, as it will lead to increased speed of the quantum-logical operations one can achieve. In addition, ion-trap chips lithographically fabricated in a &#x27;clean room&#x27; micro-fabrication environment offer the great promise of ultimate scalability, very much like the paradigm of semiconductor integrated circuits. In collaboration with the group of A. Wallraff in Zurich, we have developed such a micro-trap fabrication process. \\n\\n Current technology limitations: \\n To date, ion trap miniaturisation is impeded by two major problems: excessive electric field noise originating from trap electrodes, and electrostatic charging of the traps. The former problem exceeds the boundaries of the ion trap community. In fact, an environment with minimal electric field noise is important in many fields in science, for example nanomechanics, single spin detection, and the measurement of weak forces. Experiments with single ions trapped above metallic surfaces reveal that electric noise is several orders of magnitude stronger than that expected from Brownian motion of electrons in the trap electrodes. A known way to reduce electronic noise on trap electrodes is by operating the trap at cryogenic temperatures. Thus, construction of cryogenic ion-trap systems is a direction which many ion-trap groups are taking. \\n\\n Advances in the noise problem: \\n In the course of our work, we used single trapped ions to address both problems mentioned above: we used a single trapped ion as a movable and extremely sensitive electronic noise sensor, and as a movable electrostatic field sensor. These advances allowed us to shed new light into the possible mechanism of anomalous heating in ion traps, and to correlate trap charging with trap operation. Especially with regard to the noise problem, we established a possible connection between electric field noise and surface contamination of trap electrodes. As a result, the possibility of using surface cleaning and characterization tools to attack the problem of electric field noise is starting to be accepted by the ion trap community as a promising solution that could be used to achieve outstanding ion trap performance. This has culminated in a new direction for ion trap groups: the combination of the standard atomic phycisist&#x27;s toolbox with those of the surface scientist to try and bring modern ion traps to their full potential. We anticipate this to turn into a rather active field of research within, and perhaps even beyond, the ion trap community. \\n\\n Electrostatic field sensing: \\n In various modern ion trap experiments it is necessary to optimise the trap parameters in the presence of unknown, and possibly changing, quantities, such as stray charges on the experimental setup.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2018-07-13 15:10:18&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;220957.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;QOSC2007&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEOPLE-2007-2-1.IEF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;/docs/results/220/220957/123238271-19_en.doc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22199&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47267&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - NANOSICON (High-temperature stable nano-structured silicides for highly efficient thermogenerators and their contacting technology)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Study of high temperature thermoelectric (TE) properties of magnesium silicide and its solid solutions \\n\\n TE devices have been known as a viable and flexible principle of direct energy conversion for cooling and power generation for manifold practical applications.

Silicides of Mg and Mn are known to exhibit promising TE properties for power generation at temperatures up to about 600 degrees Celsius. The advantage of TE devices over conventional conversion techniques is their extremely high reliability (over 30 years of operation free of failure under space conditions have been reported), silent and vibration-less operation, low volume, no need of maintenance, light weight, free scalability from the sub-microwatt up to the MW region, no involvement of compressed gases or cycling fluids and environmentally friendly operation. The development and investigation of new TE materials has become recently an attractive area for research and application. The main disadvantage of TE devices is their still moderate efficiency. \\n\\n The main objective of the proposal was the development of improved Mg2Si and its solid solutions with Mg2Sn. These are promising n-type materials for thermogenerators operated at intermediate temperatures. A detailed study of the influence of doping and formation of a solid solution on the electronic and thermal transport properties has been carried out here. Firstly, the synthesis method was optimised. This is crucial due to the high vapour pressure of Mg. Under optimised synthesis conditions, doped Mg2Si and Mg2(Si,Sn) were prepared and studied. \\n\\n (a) Sb and Bi doping in Mg2Si\\n\\n - Mg2Si1-xRx (R - Sb, Bi) was synthesised in several compositions. Phase identification by X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicates biphasic nature at higher Bi concentrations while solid solubility for all Sb values. \\n - Electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were studied. Bi substitution results in an increase in the absolute value of the conductivity. For Sb substitution, an increase is observed up to x = 0.025; further addition results in a weak decrease. \\n - The thermal conductivity and the lattice component were determined. A decrease with temperature is observed, with a pronounced decrease in the presence of Sb. This might be due to the mass disorder from Sb at Si site and Mg vacancies. \\n - Maximum ZT values are similar for both Sb and Bi substitution with a maximum of 0.56 for Bi and 0.52 for Sb. \\n\\n (b) Sb doping in Mg2(Si0.4Sn0.6) \\n\\n - Measurements of carrier concentration indicated systematic increase with increased dopant addition. \\n - The thermal conductivity increases with doping. The lattice values show a significant reduction compared to the doped Mg2Si compositions. A maximum ZT value of 1.15 at 673 K was achieved. \\n\\n The two-year MCF-IIF period was completed successfully. Remarkable improvement of the TE figure of merit was achieved. Six papers related to the project have been published. These contributed significantly to TE materials research. International collaborations were enriching the success of the activity. Along with the laboratory activities, the fellow participated in research conferences and other scientific meetings. The activity has considerably opened the research scope and enhanced the academic communication between the fellow and international colleagues. \\n\\n The effect of doping on the properties in Mg2Si and Mg2(Si0.4Sn0.6) was studied with Sb resulting in pinning of carrier concentration and enhanced reduction of thermal conduction. Bi doping leads to a prominent increase in the power factor, explained by vacancy formation and secondary phases in Sb/Bi, respectively. Sb doping in Mg2(Si0.4Sn0.6) resulted in large enhancement of ZT with a maximum of 1.15 at 673 K caused by increased band degeneracy and reduced thermal conductivity in the solid solutions. Overall, this makes these materials excellent candidates for thermogenerator applications, for example in the automobile.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-02-16 13:15:52&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;221660.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NANOSICON&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEOPLE-2007-4-2.IIF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;/docs/results/221/221660/123238291-19_en.doc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;22200&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;47216&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;en&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Final Report Summary - LIGHT INDUCED SWITCH (Nanoporous materials and supramolecular clusters for light induced electronic switches)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The aim of the project entitled &#x27;light induced switch&#x27; was to design and investigated the properties of new materials and supramolecular clusters which have inbuilt light initiated switches, in the form of iron(II) spin crossover (SCO) centers, for use as optical switches and ...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The aim of the project entitled &#x27;light induced switch&#x27; was to design and investigated the properties of new materials and supramolecular clusters which have inbuilt light initiated switches, in the form of iron(II) spin crossover (SCO) centers, for use as optical switches and storage devices, molecular sensors, chemical detectors, drug delivery, data storage, displays and other electronic devices. Along all the results, three mains results have been already published, as described here after: \\n\\n - We have for instance investigated the photomagnetic properties of dinuclear material [FeII2(ddpp)2(NCS)4]*4(CH2Cl2) (ddpp = 2,5-di(2&#x27;,2&#x27;&#x27;-di-pyridylamino)-pyridine) (1*4(CH2Cl2)) and its partially desolvated analogue (1*1(CH2Cl2)), which undergo two- and one-step spin crossover (SCO) transitions, respectively. The chloroform clathrate 1*4(CHCl3) undergoes a relatively abrupt one-step SCO in which the two equivalent Fe(II) sites within the dinuclear molecule crossover simultaneously. Partial desolvation of 1*4(CHCl3) to form 1*3(CHCl3) and 1*(CHCl3) occurs via a single-crystal-to-single-crystal processes (monoclinic C2/c to P21/n to P21/n) in which the single Fe(II) site splits into two inequivalent sites within the dinuclear molecule of each phase. Both 1*3(CHCl3) and 1*1(CHCl3) undergo one-step spin transitions, with the former having a significantly higher SCO temperature than 1*4(CHCl3) and the latter, and each has a broader SCO transition than 1*4(CHCl3), attributable to the overlap of two SCO steps in each case. Further magnetic manipulation can be carried out on these materials via reversibly resolvating the partially desolvated material with chloroform to produce the original one-step SCO, or with dichloromethane to produce a two-step SCO reminiscent of that seen for as-synthesized 1*4(CH2Cl2). Furthermore, we investigate the light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) effect on 1*4(CH2Cl2) and 1*(CH2Cl2) and observe partial LIESST activity for the former and no LIESST activity for the latter. \\n\\n - We have also investigated the consequence on light- and thermally-induced spin crossover (SCO) properties with particle size reduction from the macroscopic to microscale to nanoscale domains. Three samples with distinct particle sizes of the SCO coordination polymer [Fe(NCS)2(bpe)2] (bpe = 1,2-bis(4&#x27;-pyridyl)ethane) have been prepared via water-in-oil reverse micelle methods. Comparison of the magnetic properties with particle size reduction of these and the original macroscale slow grown crystals revealed that the spin transition becomes more gradual, more incomplete and concomitantly the transition temperature (T½) decreases - much like what is observed in metal dilution studies Importantly, here, in the first photo-induced magnetic studies on a nanoparticle SCO system, we see that even on the nanoscale photo-conversion of the low spin species to a metastable high spin state is possible. Furthermore, particle size reduction appears to have little effect on the temperature at which the stored photomagnetic information is erased. These results highlight that light-induced SCO properties are governed by direct metal coordination environment (i.e. on the molecular scale), whereas, thermal induced magnetic properties rely more on crystal packing and ligand field effects. \\n\\n - Finally, we have participated to the physical study of new molecular clusters. Along that we have offered a straight-forward strategy for the in-situ ligand synthesis of a novel cyanide-bridged cyclo-metallomacrocycle [Fe4(CN)4L4](CN)2(SeCN)2 which has been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography. Magnetic measurements indicate the presence of both high and low spin Fe(II) centres, while the electrochemical data are consistent with weak electronic coupling between the adjacent metal ions. Further studies are underway to elaborate the metal ions that are amenable to this synthetic strategy.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2018-07-13 13:37:01&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FR&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;219828.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;LIGHT INDUCED SWITCH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FP7-PEOPLE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEOPLE-2007-4-2.IIF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;div class=container-fluid&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;row center-block footer-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-muted text-center&quot;&gt;Report generated with &lt;a href=https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling&gt;pandas-profiling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;script&gt;\n",
